            "This place is a complete wreck. I wait for 30 minutes to get my 4 for 4. Multiple people who ordered after me got there food first. The manager put my sandwich on the tray and it sat on the tray waiting for my other food for another 20 minutes. So my sandwich was cold. Then my fries were way way way over cooked. When I finally got my food the manager proceeded to SCREAM have a nice day at me because I did not acknowledge her the first time she said it I just nodded. On top of all that the manger had 3 buttons undone on her shirt in the middle and she did not have gloves on and she put her hands all over my fries. NOT SANITARY AT ALL!\n",
            "The worst!  They frequently get orders wrong, you get less food than what you paid for.  Of the food you get it is typically of low quality and quantity.  Bukahra may have been around for 20 years, but my opinion is this establishment will be gone in the near future.\n",
            "Every time I go here, the service is terrible. I went last week and had to wait a while to get served. They only 2 people working the line. There was a manager who was just looking on and not helping out. You can tell one of the girls on the line who was making all the sandwiches with the fixings was stressed out. The other guy who asked what kind of sandwich you want was rude. He even burned my sandwich in the oven. Just validating their terrible service again! I will not visit this store again.\n",

I called a server over to ask what it was and she said it was a syrup and then grabbed the chopsticks off of my plate and started rapidly stirring this clear gelatinous syrup in the bottom of his cup, spilling it and ice everywhere and then said. \"Okay, try it now\" then put my chopsticks back onto my plate for me to use. All while I am watching this gelatinous goo settle back to the bottom of his cup.\n",

DO NOT go here to conduct business. I have never been treated with such disrespect, and to disrespect my business partners and make us lose business. forget this place to many other fantastic eats in portland\n",
            "If I could this place zero stars I would. One word. VALENTINA. Every bite of every plate was drenched in Valentina hot sauce. I cannot hate on Valentina because I do love it, but only on certain foods and at my discretion. Everything we ordered -from the queso appetizer to the steak plate - HAD VALENTINA. I have never heard of a person that ate steak drenched in Valentina, or put Valentina in their queso...\n",

            "This place literally has like 10 item menu and they could not get one of them right. They have what seems to be a signature burrito that the place is suppose to be known for. My boyfriend had this before and he loved it, this time around the burrito was smaller and full of only rice. Not sure what is up with this place but I truly hope they either consider revising their menu or get rid of their chef.\n",
            "One of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. Think of going to a Chinese buffet that also serves 'seafood' that is always questionable and you just skip it to be safe. This entire restaurant is that questionable seafood you want to just skip. EVERYTHING is dried out, overcooked, over poached, or just plain smelled awful. We paid over $100 for dinner for two and could not even finish our first plates! Pushed the plates, paid the exorbitant rates for this swill, and left before we stuck to something. Oh, and if you want a real treat, try the bathrooms! Wow! Something positive... the staff was friendly.\n",
            "It was the worst service ever. It started good at first. My friends and I decided to eat here because it may be good to try. We went inside and they placed us in the table and all. They were taking our order and stuff. Then the problem started. My friends' orders already arrived but mine was not still there. So I waited because I thought maybe it takes longer to make. I waited for so long and decided to call one of the waitresses. I asked where my food was and she went to the back. I saw her being flustered and all. I thought to myself that maybe the other waitress did not write my order. She came back and said that the people in the kitchen did not make my food and just started making it. I was so disappointed like ohmyghad I waited for like an hour for my food and now I have to wait for more. Then they just brought in my food (thank God). After we ate, we paid the exact amount and left it on the table. We were outside when the waitress chased us and said that we did not pay enough. In my mind I was like wtf!!!! She said that we did not pay the 10% tip. Myghad of course we did not give any tip because your service sucked. In the end, we gave the money and I was so frustrated. I should have argued with her. I will not be coming there next time.\n",
            "Completely overrated. The clam chowder is the worst I have ever had. The presentation of the food makes you lose your apetite. The sides that come with the main dish taste like they either come straight out of a can or the microwavable isle. The shrimp is not deveined, so you got to be careful not to eat the colon.\n",
            "Worst fish and chips i have ever had.  Poor service.  Couple next to us also had a very poor dining experience.\n",
            "Just had lunch here. Ordered the 77/pork chop with rice. Asked the waiter to bring a side of soup. I am used to getting the soup on the side for no extra charge. The bill came and I was being charged 4.50. Let me explain 4.50 for a tiny rice bowl sized soup that had a few garnishings in it. I do not mind paying I just think it was a little much for not very much...\n",
            "Thanks for ruining my bachelorette dinner! I have waited years to write this review to cool down from the experience I had here. The old location was WAY better as was the old management. Why they moved and changed things up is beyond me because it seems they now want to flush their business down the toilet. I will not deeply elaborate on what happened to me because I do believe that you can catch a place on a bad night. However, the food is precooked and sits under a heating lamp. It comes to your table so quickly because of this butbits rather disgusting. A friend who recently dined here confirmed this exact suspicion. \n",

            "My family tried this place last night for the first time to go see Inside Out....I wish I would have known more about the way things worked before I went. The over all atmosphere was  ritzy, nice, and very clean. The movie was displayed nicely and the seats were very cushiony and comfortable. I did not realize I paid for the cheaper seats that do not offer food service and that was really inconvenient. The lady at the front told me I could order at my seat but I guess she was wrong. I had four kids with me and my husband had to stay with them while I brought out food for everyone...I felt like I was interrupting other people....and I missed a lot of the movie. Our dinner, dessert, Alcohol, and tickets added up to $230. An employee whom I believe was a manger, saw me carrying a lot of food on my own so he offered to help, which was very nice of him but when I grabbed the tray from him half of my 15$ pizza fell on the floor and they did not offer to bring out a replacement, that made me upset. I spent a lot of money with them and he saw I was struggling, I just think that they should have done something about it. Another thing I really did not like...I saw him touch his face at the food counter and then pick up some fries it his bare hands and place them in our dish. They hype up the food with the names and the price as if your getting some amazing gourmet meal, and do not get me wrong they also present it well, but it was like cafeteria grade food if you get what I mean....not good...not worth those outrages prices. This just goes to show you looks are not everything....it looks awesome and its comfortable....but so is the movie house off 620 and there prices are a tad cheaper and the overall experience dining and all was much better and they had really unique menu and the food was amazing and everyone gets service regardless of the seating.\n",

            "We had a restaurant.com certificate or would have never gone here. We waited for one hour for our food while they served a small party from the hotel at the bar We paid $38 for a dainty caesar salad and a dainty dish with 2 scallops and 2 small pieces of pork belly.\n",
            "This place has really gone down hill for me. The service is always bad and everything is way overpriced but they seemed to make up for it with their food. Unfortunately even that seems to have gone downhill, serving probably the worst lobster roll I have ever had and an over-cooked, over-seasoned clam chowder. I have been here many times over the years but I am unlikely to return.\n",
            "Not thrilled with this experience at all.  I am sitting here looking at an empty water glass, the plate of croquettes I started with (that were cold in the middle) that was never cleared off the table, the over dressed salad that I was rushed on and my salty beef bourguignon that did not match the menu description.\n",

Well, I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. The girl that was making it had her hair in her face (not working around food appropriote. style) I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food. I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it is a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! \n",

            "My sister and I went for dinner last night.  We decided to share the appetizer platter and ordered a side of fries. For $27,  the platter is not worth it. It came with spinach and artichoke dip which looked like it was microwaved , 4 hot wings, soggy burnt brushetta, and the chicken bites were cold. The fries were also cold and soggy. I would much rather buy from frozen at m&m meat shop and cook it from the comfort of my own home. Quality of food is not worth the time or money. Very disappointed. Will NEVER go back.\n",
            "The food is great. However, the service is the exact opposite. Always refuse take out during busy hours. They also will not split the check if you go with a group. I guess simple math is too challenging.   They also will not seat your party until everyone is present.  If you have a party of 4 but 3 are there, they make you wait.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Terrible  customer service!\n",

            "I did not appreciate the guy and girl look at me like I am some kind of degenerate because I requested Kale instead of lettuce for my salad. I need to eat kale because I have vitamin a and c deficiency and being laughed at by your staff for my condition is not something I need. Would still go back though because the food is great.\n",
            "My friends and I had dinner two weeks ago at this restaurant and we were very disappointed. Service was slow and definitely over priced . Food did not have any flavor, we ordered salmon dish, shrimp and lamb. The waiter was nice but she was overwhelmed. \n",
            "Not going back there anymore or recommend to anyone.\n",
            "Very disappointed! We ordered Dosa and they gave us 'daal' instead of 'sambar' as if we will not know it. Just because it was an hour before their closing time, does not mean they would serve us with leftovers...! AND the dosa was quite thick as well. Will not go back except for their Chole Bathure, hopefully they will not mess up with that, in order to save themselves an effort!\n",
            "Horrible service... after 20 minutes at the table we had to ask the hostess where our waiter was.  Then we watched all the employees stand around and try and pass us off on each other.  Eventually the \"unluckiest\" came to our table to get us started.  He brought the four items we ordered to the table separately and brought the beer that one person ordered last.  Waiter came back to give us the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Another beer was ordered, which seemed to be an imposition since the check was already ready.  At the end, he gave us his name and asked us to come back.  I think not....\n",
            "This is place is in the bottom 1% of my Chinese food experiences.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is creepy and the food tastes bad.\n",
            "Horrible experience. Food takes forever and it is not even good.\n",
            "I wish I could tell you how the food was. However, upon arrival to this establishment,  we were greeted by a not so friendly host that informed us he could not serve us. Why, you ask?? We were a group of eleven. I have never---ever been turned away from any restaurant until today.\n",
            "This is probably the worst pizza hut location I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Every time I order, something always seems to go wrong with their deliveries. They are consistently a half hour or more late on delivering, forget necessary supplies in order to sign receipts, do not provide all the items I order forcing me to either call and wait for them to deliver again while my pizza gets cold or just choose to suck it up and go without. They are customer service is often full of sarcasm, and they seem to get a kick out of parking in reserved parking at my apartments, one driver even going so far as to cut me off and take my parking spot while I was trying to pull into it. I will never order pizza from this location again, nor would I recommend anyone to. If I could rate 0 stars, I would.\n",
            "It is so funny When fast food scam you, I ordered a Beaconator and I only get 4 small strips of beacons. This will be the last time I will get it from Wendy's again. What a waste of money. I should of got a burger from Burger King instead :(.\n",
            "We went here for $1 oysters.  We got there minutes before the happy hour ended but it was too late by the time the waitress took our order.  Apparently the computer charges automatically based on whether it is still happy hour time or not.  Perhaps we could have just gone straight to the bar when we had arrived to order our oysters.\n",
            "\n",
            "So instead we ordered a dozen oysters.  They were definitely not worth it and would not have even been worth it at $1.  I was getting oyster shells in my mouth with each oyster. It ruined the experience. You should be able to just slurp up an oyster and enjoy it without having to spit out she will over and over.\n",
            "\n",
            "Would not go here for the oysters.\n",
            "Do not eat here. Avoid this restaurant at all cost. I waited 30 minutes for a shrimp and fish plate and a four piece fish plate. I contacted the area manager and he showed very little resolve to my plight. Everyone, from the area manager to the cashier, was apologetic. I would recommend going to Baltimore seafood on Peter St. Instead. I am personally boycotting this restaurant for life. They will never see my hard earned money again.\n",
            "We arrived in Boston last night and we are so excited to dine here. What DISAPPOINTMENT!  \"higher\" thank PF Changs. No sure how the chef is a James Beard award winner..  server Xavier was amazing!!!  Really bummed that we wasted a night here.\n",
            "One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. This location should not even exist. There was multiple hairs in our food (mind you me and my family all have black hair and the hairs were blonde) and we were disrespected so much by the server. When asking for the manager, I heard the server call my friend a bitch to another server. This will be the first and last time coming here. STAY AWAY!!!\n",
            "If you are looking for good tasting food that is cooked properly and served well, then this is not the place for you.  Not sure what has happened since they first opened other then the quality of the preparation and actual taste degrading severely.  Its really unfortunate that this place could not fill the void left behind by Cafe Luigis.  I would not waste your money or time on this place, the food is cheap and you barely get what you pay for.  Hopefully they will close down soon and give another a place a shot at serving decent Italian fare.  I realize this is a chain so I am would be hesitant to try any of the other establishments.\n",
            "Horrible experience at this restaurant. We were a party of 9 and were told that there would be a 25 minute wait. We sat in the bar for over an hour and had to ask 3 times before someone was able to give us an approximate time for being seated, we then waited an additional 15 minutes.  after we were seated it took 30 minutes before the waited took our order. during this entire time several other parties of 5 or greater were seated served and left. I have never had such poor service at any other restaurant. The manager did not even bother to come over and explain the situation to us. Will not be returning here or recommending it to anyone I know.\n",
            "Wish I could give them NO stars! Sucks ass! Charge my credit card twice and told me to take it up with my bank!\n",
            "I have one tip of advice - do not eat here. \n",
            "\n",
            "I have lived in Waltham for many years, just down the street from this place and I would rather walk a mile to get food than to settle for NY Deli. I used to love the steak tips and would order all the time until I found out how unsanitary they are. Meat and other products sit out for long periods of times. They are incredibly rude and do not seem to care for their customers at all. Not to mention the last time I was in my food was about $10 and I gave the cashier a $20 and they refused to give me my change because he said I gave him a ten. He told me to come back in an hour when the manager was there to check the camera to see how much I gave him. Fine. Went back an hour later and the manager refused to check. What happened to the customer is always right? Hope they enjoyed that extra ten dollars because I will never be eating there again. Bad quality food and incredibly rude service\n",
            "Horrible from start to finish! I wanted to like this place, I really did. After all, we were booked there for a week. Luckily, the only problem I did not encounter was the pushy sales people. I am afraid had I dealt with them, it would have pushed me over the edge. Gosh, I just really wish there was a negative option on here. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Upon arrival my husband and I went in the lobby to check in. From the looks it was ok, a little dated, but ok. The gentleman that checked us in was quite nice. It was a bit loud in the lobby for midnight which surprised me. There were not too many cars coming in when we first arrived. However, when we were done and walking back out there were a ton of people out there, but I will get back to that. I consider myself a very careful person as I have seen things happen and I like to watch myself. While crossing that parking lot to go back to our rental, we saw a shuttle van coming so we walked fast across the lot as to have plenty time to get to the other side. This jerk off driving seriously almost hit my husband and I. He was driving extremely fast to be in a parking lot full of people. Now, back to the people that appeared after our check in. When we walked back out from being inside about 15 minutes I would say there were about 20 people in the parking lot. Cars parked, doors open, trunks open, music blaring, cursing, screaming, etc. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. We arrive in our room about 12:30AM. Parking was almost unseen. We go up stairs to our room. As I walked in I noticed it was really dated with some pretty bad paintings. But, hey I am no interior designer. It looks \"ok\" until I start looking a bit more. There were black spots in the floor in the bathroom, in the bathtub, caked up dirt and dust under the counter in the bathroom, etc. I also noticed a spiral staircase leading up to what looked to be another room in our already 3 bedroom condo. I walked in to see what exactly was up there. It was another room with another room number, and a door leading outside. So it was the upstairs room. Luckily, no one was inside. I was a little panicked though because after all I have a 4yo and I am a very protective moma when it comes to my kid and who has access to him. So, I went to my rental van, drove up front to talk to the front desk......\n",
            "\n",
            "3. As I round the corner to the front area I notice there are double, maybe even triple the vehicles parked out front, with equally as many thugs hanging out. I walked inside and while waiting in line to talk to someone there was a girl maybe in her early 20's who proceeded to curse and scream on the other side of the lobby to anyone who would over a listening ear. While doing so, she decided it is totally appropriate to take her shirt and bikini top off. Yep, boobs hanging every where. Do you all think security was called? Do you think reception tried to stop it? They did not even bat an eye at this situation. The manager looked up at her and looked right back down! I mean, really?!?!?! Get a grip. When walking back out trying to get to my vehicle, I felt like I was at a nightclub/rave with 20yo kids. Very disappointing. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. Security finally came and locked our door. We were so exhausted we went to bed instead of investigating anything else. The next morning we woke up, I rolled over to give my husband a morning kiss and noticed a red mark on the sheet. Naturally, I gave him a once over to see if he was bleeding. He was not, it was nasty stains on our sheets! I pulled the cover off and noticed nasty brown and red stains all over the sheets, pillows, and mattress! Also on the other bed as well. I called housekeeping and requested all sheets and pillows be changed while we were gone. We were at Magic Kingdom all day. We arrived back at our room around midnight. Guess what? Our sheets had not been changed. At this point I was furious. I called front desk and demanded they bring new ones. I kid you not, 15 minutes later a man knocks on my door, hands me a clear garbage bag with sheets!!! Are you kidding me?!?! At this point my mother in law calls and complains, but there was no solution. \n",

            "5. We left the next morning (Tuesday) to continue our vacation at Epcot. We were again gone all day. Returned maybe 10PM. Upon arrival our door was standing open. I, again called the front desk and requested someone come up because the door was open. All I got was a sorry as excuse that it may have been housekeeping and they would look into it. Oh yea, great idea to have your housekeepers keep the doors open all day while you are gone. Yep, that feels real safe! \n",
            "\n",
            "6. On one of these days in between (I honestly do not remember when) my husband was sitting out on our balcony enjoying the weather when he saw a maintenance guy walk around the pool, to inspect he had thought. Only to sit there and watch the guy spit in the kids pool! Again, all complaints that we called about were not even acknowledged!\n",
            "Really? Items in this picture are SMALLER than they appear. A $5 dollar breakfast bowl with the dimensions of 4 in x 2 in. Aka  SIDE item at any BBQ place. What a joke. And the food sucks too. Nasty flour tortillas.\n",
            "I went here for brunch on a Sunday which was advertised to last from 11-5. Once I arrived I was offered a limited menu, again different from what was advertised and then was told that I could not order any food for 45 min to an hour due to the kitchen \"flipping over\". The wait staff was not knowledgeable of the menu for food or the bar. Despite the disappointing experience it is a really nice restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere.\n",
            "Update. So, we decided to give them another shot. Never again for this location.\n",
            "We came in on 02/02/2018 @ 1:04pm. The server, Jeremiah was good. Took our order. All seemed like a turn around visit.\n",
            "Not so. We get our food. I had the Southern Charm burger. First bite, going pretty well so far. Wash it down with a sip of my drink. \n",
            "Second bite, still good. Wait for it...\n",
            "Third bite. Something is amiss. There is a mint flavor that and solid mass that I am picking up. I pull this hardened lump of white fused gum from the sandwich. \n",
            "This is where I determine that I am done eating and about to wretch.\n",
            "We get the manager of the hour to come by, and she proceeds to tell me \"I find this hard to believe. We have a strict policy of no gum.\" To this I tell her, \"well that is gum. That much I know. So...\" as she is pulling the gum a part. \n",
            "Finally, she comes to the conclusion that it is gum and there is no denying it, but wait, she tries one more time to reassign blame and make an assertion that it was not her staff by saying \"we I do not know how this would have happened. We have a very strict policy against gum chewing, but okay. Do you want a replacement or something else to eat? Fries? Do you want me to credit your sandwich.\"\n",
            "I tell her \"No I have lost my appetite. Please, remove the sandwich.\" As she walks way, she rolls her eyes.\n",

The sauerkraut, the marinated pickles, and the herring were awful. The sauerkraut was soggy and had no crunch. The pickles were super soggy and soft. The herring was old and lost all its firmness. Not only it was upsetting to me and my guests, but it was just a disappointment that one of our stores could serve/sell so many items that are not fresh or were poorly made, bought, and/or sold.\n",
            "We went there for the first time with a friend last night, it was pretty crowded so we were seated at the bar. We had only come to have a drink. We were just finishing up our drinks and our friend went to the bathroom. While we were sitting there the woman who looked like the manager, curly hair middle aged came over to the bar and said to the bartender \"I thought these spots were going to be open\" Referencing that she thought we would be gone. We had literally just paid, and she comes over, close enough that I can hear her. Rude. We just had $11 drinks and now you are trying to rush me out the door. Not going back.\n",
            "I ordered two lbs of head on shrimps for take out, very disappointed, this is the second time ordering take out from this location. First time was great, shrimps were very fresh and crispy. Tonight at least 1 lb of the shrimps were mushy, some of them were stinky too. My family and I were very disappointed and not sure if we want to order from them again.\n",
            "The food was good. But the service was vey slow. We held a charity event there on Cinco de Mayo and constituted the majority of the business that night. But, never got the donation check. It was agreed to donate 20% of what we spent that night and almost 3 months later, we have not heard from them. Definitely will not be partnering or going back. Good luck to them.\n",
            "I have never written a bad -- or really bad -- restaurant review. I do not write many reviews in general, although I do eat out quite a bit. I usually only write something if I really, really like the place. But, my meal at Felt last night before the theater was without a doubt the very worst meal I have ever paid for outside my home. Really.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Taylor brought us our very ordinary drinks after we heard that there really was no cocktail menu.  Then, we ordered burgers -- the veggie burger was so black that it was indistinguishable.  The turkey burger was like leather.  And, my beef burger? So well done that even with a knife I could not cut it.  The rolls were hard, not warmed at all.\n",

            "That is it.  I am done. Well done.\n",

            "Call in a take out order at 5:30.  Told an hour and a half wait. I say, really?  They say between 6:30 and 7.  we call back at 6:35. They say another 1/2 hour.  Show up at 7:10.  The take out line is out the door. I wait 20 min in line that does not move with few people leaving with take out orders.  There is no system, no one calls out names. Just one woman who struggles with the ipad system while answering phone calls. Someone finds out there is an order waiting with our name on it so I go to the front of the line, wait another 10 min. Finally I get my order, go home, it is lukewarm at best. Food is barely tolerable but 2 items are unacceptable. Beef Teriyaki is burnt beyond recognition. Inedible. I will upload a photo as proof.  Yu Hsiang pork not very good, but became horrendous, when I started to crunch on a piece of metal, perhaps a mangled staple? Wanted to go back and complain but could not face the entire scene again.\n",
            "Tonight was a huge disappointment. We arrived before the dinner rush. Our server took our order and served our drinks - never to be seen again. Salad starter arrived with the main course by another server. Clearly we were forgotten. No one ever checked back in with us to see if everything was satisfactory or to offer a refill on our drinks. We had to flag another server down to get our check. Will not be returning - extremely poor service. Too many other good choices in this area of Orlando.\n",
            "This used to be my favorite place for a sinfully delicious treat, sadly it is changed. The cherry bomb cupcake had strange colorless cherries with an odd texture within it. The frosting was greasy, salty and just not yummy in any way. I miss the old Tea and Cakes.\n",
            "We tried very hard to eat here, but awful treatment by the staff made it impossible. The menu looked good and the outside seating was a good option for us, because we had our baby and our dog with us. Families with babies and/or small dogs are very common on Newbury Street, but the hostess treated us like lepers. We took the farthest table in the corner to be out of the way. We tied the dog to the railing of a nearby staircase, because they would not let us tie him\n",
            "to the outside of the patio fence (even though the vast majority of restaurants allow this- it is a common sight on Newbury). They do not have high chairs (!), so we prepared to sit with my son on our laps. We put the stroller well out of the way, outside the patio fence on the side without foot traffic. The whole time we were trying to arrange ourselves, the hostess made sour faces, shook her head at us and said \"No, no\" from time to time. I swear we are not that ungainly a group, but she looked absolutely horrified that we were eating there. So we gave up and left. Maybe they just strongly do not want families eating there; I do not know. But the snooty attitude was outrageous for such a middle-of-the-road looking pizza and sandwich joint! We easily found a bistro on the next block that was more than accommodating and friendly.\n",

I do have my receipt and will be following up with both my bank and the hotel but how disappointing!  I really expect a lot more from such an establishment.

The calamari appetizer was ok, but tempura frying is not rocket science.  Then, the main course... that came out 45 minutes later, about 20 minutes after the rest of my party got their food.  Teriyaki chicken.  Essentially, a grilled chicken breast with some vegetables that were stir fried for maybe 2 minutes, then drizzled with some \"teriyaki\" sauce that tasted like it came from a microwave meal.  I wondered why our server attended us with what seemed like a tinge of fear... I guess her conscience was gnawing at her for what she was about to do to our tastebuds.\n",

Multiple people touched my food with their bare hands after they finished cooking it. Lastly, the quantity is very small for what you pay. Had to go to Chipotle afterwards just to feel full.

We waited even longer. Finally two quesos arrived at our table. Typically for us an order of queso is consumed in a matter of minutes.

The fries had a strong taste of FISH GREASE so much so that I had to let someone else taste one because I thought it was me but they agreed that fries tasted as if they were fried in old fish grease as well. Needless to say I dumped the entire plate in the trash so I dumped $7 along with it basically. I did call back to let them know that the food was not good and they offered 10% off my next meal which most likely I will not ever use because I will not be going back.\n",

I tried to eat the boneless wings, they are gross and nothing but salty breading. The side of slaw was buried in mayo like goo. And the waitress did not even get my order correct. There was also a gentleman sitting next to me at the bar, who was also a new patron. He ordered a steak and could barely eat it since it was nothing but fat. He did complain to the wait staff. \n",

            "I have driven past this place many times as I sometimes meet clients in the area so was excited to try this place for a friend's birthday. I would have thought that if you only had 9 entrees on the menu all should come out outstanding so I was disappointed I had to return the food to the kitchen 3 times.

            "First I ordered steak frites (flank) medium rare and it came out overcooked. There was only 7 pieces of steak to begin with and the few pieces on each end were fully cooked with no pink visible. Texture of the meat was also rubbery. Although I was going to upgrade to the rib eye the pricing on the menu is misleading and it is actually an additional $21 to sub, which some of the comments below mentioned.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second I switched to the Pacific Salmon which was cooked fine except for the fact the skin was overly salted especially when they only serve a tiny slice of fish. I was not surprised as this particular cook was over salting a lot of things including my buddy's pizza. Also the salt thrown over the fries landed in only one particular spot so if you did not mix the fries you got a mouthful of salt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third I had the fish remade and this time the manager came out to apologize and comp my meal. The chef who at this point was likely stressing out did not salt my fish at all. Fine I did not care at this point but the fish was now served under cooked and you could tell looking once you sliced through the fish they tried to say it is supposed to be like this yet the first time they brought it out it was cooked properly so very inconsistent. Sorry but I cook trout with the skin bi-weekly sprinkled with salt/pepper in a cast iron grill (you can teach anyone in 5 minutes) and fish is incredibly easy to cook.\n",

We heard that the quesarrito is a secret menu item, and my friend had already had two from other locations and was raving...so we literally turned down a quality free meal to go here. We TRIED to order two quesarritos. They scoffed, some bitter-faced guy in the back made some snobby comment about how if we wanted that, we could go down the street to Taco Bell. The 6 or more employees were all over the place with their reactions. One said they did not make those at that location. The other said we were not the first. Yet another said they only make them when the back line is open. Finally, they reluctantly agreed to do it after warning us it would be $15. Money was not our concern, and we told them we would wait as long as they needed. They proceeded to go back and forth and nobody even attempted to start making anything for 5 minutes. The whole time, we were saying things like, \"if it is a problem, just say no.\" And inevitably there was some half-hearted \"I mean, normally we do not....but we will, but it is super inconvenient....but do not worry....but it is annoying.\" Finally, a super bothered lady came to see what we wanted and was so inconvenienced by the whole thing that we told them to forget it. And we left. Thanks for  pussy-footing, and thanks for literally nothing. Treating people with kindness, even when saying no, is ALWAYS preferred.\n",
            "i do not normally post reviews no matter how bad my experience was, but this place is so terrible that i created a yelp account just to post a review. our first experience was last valentine's day and we waited 2 hours for our order. 2 hours! we did numerous follow-ups but they must have forgotten our order. we saw groups of people who came in, ate, and left. and we were still there, patiently waiting for our order. we let it slide because it was a busy night for them, but we got no apologies whatsoever. \n",

That was the logic behind going to this one.  But oh man was it bad.  All the burritos were super soggy, kind of like they threw slop inside of them; there was no texture at all.  I also made the mistake of ordering a caesar salad: worst caesar I have ever had.  And on top of that they messed up the order and put onions all over the salad??? Not sure why that was.  But yeah, I would NOT recommend this location.\n",

I can get over the employees sitting outside enjoying their cigarette breaks, I can get over them skipping the sink to wash their hands on the way in to gather by hand my bagels, I can get over the fact it is not the cleanest looking bagel shop, I can even get over having everything I order scrutinized to the point of changing most of it around, BUT I cannot get over the poor customer service. Its sad to see that this generational establishment has been handed off to a relative that is rude, negative and seems at times strung out.  Good bye Katz....it is been real....REAL difficult to just get a damn bagel toasted with cream cheese, hold the attitude.\n",
            "I get iced cappuccino light at Tim Horton's often.  It is literally the same as a regular iced Capp but with milk instead of cream.  All of the locations around me get it right except for this one.  Every time I go they make it with cream.  Even worse, when I tell them that it is not light, they tell me it is.  It is obvious when it is not.  The light is more thinner, darker, and has a distinct different flavor.  I get the light because I do not like how rich it is with the cream and I like the stronger coffee flavor.  It is so frustrating that it keeps happening at this location only.\n",

            "I have spent enough time at the Downtown Lake Eola Panera to drive all the way to Winter Park rather than spend much time in this one (although WP is not much better). Half the employees at the Eola location appear to be stoned. The other half are hapless teenagers who treat the dining room like it is a basement den and the parents are on vacation. I have complained now, twice, to the Panera corporate website because whenever I go in there I have a bad experience.  They send me 15 dollars and nothing changes. So in an effort to convince them to get their act together, I have elected to publish these pretty godawful experiences on Yelp. \n",
            "\n",
            "One day I am sitting there and an employee sits down next to me to have a loud and obscene conversation on his cell phone in the middle of his shift. Half the employees walk around the restaurant with hands-free pieces in their ears talking rather than working. They drink out of open cups in front of guests and do not change their gloves after handling food or themselves. I had a guy tie his shoe by placing his foot on the counter while he was taking my order, and then proceed to get me a bagel without washing his hands or putting on new gloves. The next time I go in, I cannot sit down because there are multiple 4-top booths occupied by single employees who are sitting down texting and drinking soda, either on their breaks or waiting for their shifts to start. Either way, why are they there? Why are not they in the back or outside where they are not in the way? So much for prioritizing the paying guest experience. The last time I went there (today), my coffee is cold, over 2 hours old, and has weird flecks of whitish something-or-other (looked like flywings) in it. The managers appear so preoccupied doing the work that the staff seems incapable of doing that they are not even paying attention to the lack of work ethic by their young and clearly dysfunctional staff. None of the coffee is refilled on a regular schedule like at other Parena locations I have frequented, and all of the various paper and sugar and whatnot is constantly out without employees restocking it. The dining room is a disaster at weird times of day (11 am after AM rush, 2pm well after lunch rush, 5 pm before dinner). The general attitude of the staff is not at all congenial or helpful. They sometimes make you wait for minutes while they talk before helping you place an order. I have been to few places as dysfunctionally managed as this location, and all of them were on college campuses. This one needs to be completely gutted. The staff is clearly full of bad apples and the management is either unwilling or unable to root out whatever the causes are that keep the staff acting so consistently underwhelming.\n",
            "Visited the Blackbird on friday Dec 9th around 10pm.  I have never experienced worse service from bartenders in my 29 years of being a customer but also as financial controller in the hospitality industry .  This pub belongs to a group that owns and operates several pubs so perhaps this is where they go wrong in their training/maintaining of staff.  I have worked for a company that owns several pubs for years and i see it in my own workplace.  I think the owner/mgrs should check the security cameras as the guy that served me was clearly drunk!  I witnessed him doing shots with other customers just prior to ordering my drinks after waiting at the bar with no acknowledgement whatsoever.  Honestly, we were not once acknowledged at this establishment and it was not busy at all...now i know why.  I have never had the pleasure of trying the food here so cannot comment but based on service, i will Never be back and may steer clear of any other of the pubs from this group. Seems as though they should get a manager that is a little older to control the posse of pretentious youngens they have serving drinks here.  Downright embarrasing.\n",
            "If I could put 0 starts I would! This place was the worst service I have ever received!!!! I was expecting adequate service but I was turned away and neglected like a stray dog in the rain ! While in the hours of operations! I arrived 20 minutes prior to closing and was informed by a gentleman that they only deliver! If I am already at the location why would not they just hand me my pizza and tell me they only deliver! My hotel is 5 miles away! Worst dominoes of life ! Never having pizza from here again switching to Pizza Hut!\n",
            "Went there after leaving Corellis in Clermont because of the price and atmosphere. Been here many times and have sat at the bar before................WHAT A DISASTER!!!!!  The young man behind the bar could give a crap about customers and service!!!!  Greeted us and then  walked around the bar to talk to someone about his baby mama right behind us!!! He then walked back behind the bar and chugged some trail mix from a bag, proceeded to pour himself a glass of water and then picked his teeth with his fingers while sitting on a step stool behind the bar!!!! WTF!!!!  We then were serviced by the young lady after being ignored by the punk..........We ordered two large glasses of wine and a tomato caprese and side of fettuccine alfredo as well as fried mozz, which they were out of..........I asked to keep the menu to possibly order something else.  We sat there for a bit and were not offered bread or water...........the tomato caprese came and a side of alfredo sauce?!? We then sat there for a bit with no plates, silverware or napkins.....the \"punk\" ignored us and the girl finally realized we were not going to eat it with our fingers............The Fettuccine Alfredo came and it looked worse than Rice a Roni from a box with no sauce what so ever.............The \"punk\" then came by to check on us and I said everything is fine except for the pasta.....he said \"what do you want me to do with it\".........are you Fing kidding me............I said it is dry and cold .........he took it away and proceeded to pick his teeth........at this point I told them we are done and we decided to go to Publix and get Tira Misu there and not put up with the crappy service and food. $30.00 for two \"large\" wine pours, a tomato caprese app..........really!!!!????\n",

            "I ordered my food online, when I picked up my food, the girl at the bar was so unpleasant because I asked for my drink with no ice. No tip for her. When I got home, I opened the box to find hard & dry burgers....grrrrrr never, never again! I would rather starve!\n",

            "Okay, after all the talk, this was the biggest restaurant dissapointment I have had in quite some time. The food was horrible and the service and wharehouse decor are the pits.  Am I missing something?\n",
            "My delivery order got mixed up, so I called asking about it. The man who picked up was the rudest, nastiest person I have ever spoken to about food orders. He was impatient, his tone was disgusting, and he hung up on me after saying that I still had to pay for what I ordered (even though I said I was paying in cash, so it does not make any sense). This is actually a shame because I was looking forward to trying the food as I am currently a resident on Mission Hill, but it looks like I will not be stepping in there any time soon, unless it is to criticize them for such poor customer service. I am fuming and in shock at how incredibly rude the man was.\n",

            "On vacation and ate here yesterday. My husband and I both found hair in our food AND I definitely have a touch of food poisoning. We were on vacation and took it back to our place we were staying which was not all that close so I could not bring it back. My food went through several people before making it to me I noticed. Whoever owns this one needs to come in and do an overhaul. I do not think I will eat at one of these places again anytime soon. NEVER will I go to this location for sure!\n",
            "This place used to be managed and ran beautifully! The food was great, service was superior and friendly! Ever since the new management has taken over the food has declined substantially. It is basically the only place near me to eat and sometimes I rather go hungry. Over priced. Crappy food. Terrible service. While I write this I have been waiting for 25 min for a poutine and the person before me has been waiting nearly an hour for a burger at a CAFE!!!!!!!\n",
            "Down, down..... gone. The food here used to  be pretty great, depending on what you ordered I suppose. Then it went down to good, now just BAD. I feel like i just ate a salt with a side of meatballs. I am a 2 minute walk from here, one would think this should be one of my go to's. Ya, NO! I hated coming here because the service was awful. Mind you I understand the area since I live here and I am referring to non game days when the bar is maybe 30% full max. I have walked out at least 3x due to lack of service. Yet I am perplexed it took me this long to write a review. Tonight I ordered the lamb meatballs for the 2nd time.  The 1st time I had them, they were phenomenal, almost perfection... I thought to myself if the service was better here i would probably come here every other week just to have these! Yumm. Tonight, my 2nd time ordering them, they came with a spicy mayo \"bed\" I supposed to cover up the actual terrible taste.\n",

            "Was seated with one menu for a party of five, we had to get our own additional chair (table had 4) and the remainder menus. We ordered table side guacamole and another app. The other app came out and we waited twenty minutes and no table side guac. We were told they were too busy and would we be okay with the premade? Entrées arrived. I had ordered the chicken crispers with a side salad, a meal I have had before. The chicken came out with very light colored (undercooked) batter that was sliding off the chicken and it was all grease. The waitress caught it immediately and said they would make new ones. Unfortunately, the new ones came after my entire party was done eating. I got it, it was crazy busy and the waitress seemed like she was having a rough day. The young man expediting was also very nice and kept checking to see if we got the food. I could tell they were really trying but things were not going smoothly. They would ask someone to refill our drinks and it would take 10 minutes... just typical growing pains and hectic kitchen type stuff.\n",

            "Bill comes around and the waitress made an easy error and double charged our meal, so she said she needed a manager to come over and remove the additional charge. So the manager comes over and says he heard about the chicken. We said yeah you know first one came or awful, but we got the new one and it looks great and we showed him in the to go box. He then proceeds to tell me I ordered the original crispers, which I must not have liked so he is glad they could replace it with the extra crispy ones for me since that is obviously the one I should have ordered. I said no I meant to order the original, I just wanted cooked ones and the waitress offered to make fresh ones and this is what they gave me. Again he lectures me on the menu. He was rude and awfully condescending to a table who never asked to speak to a manager nor to be comped. We told him listen, you have nice staff who are working hard- that is really the only thing we want to tell you. \n",
            "\n",
            "He then says he will comp the chicken and walks off... and then no one comes back for ten minutes. We flag or waitress and say hey, we do not need anything comped- we would really just like to pay and leave. Unfortunately, because we were double charged, we cannot leave without him signing off of removing that charge anyway. So we watched him walk around and around for another ten minutes before she flags him down on the check.\n",

Needless to say, I will not be returning the this establishment any time soon (if at all), and would suggest anyone else to choose the pick-up option so you might actually get your food at a warm temperature.\n",

The gentleman that initially was taking my order, Oumar, had an associate trainer name tag but had no idea how to ring my sandwich in. He then proceeded to tell me that they no longer had it, with an attitude. I continued to tell him that it has not been on the menu for quite some time. He asked a fellow employee named Sandy to help him ring in this simple order. Sandy seemed to know what she was doing until 2 MORE employees had to help. How many people does it take to ring in a sandwich?!? Apparently 4. After completing my order and paying for my food, I proceeded over to the pickup station. Of course, they messed up my order...shocker. My sandwich was not on the correct bread. I kindly told the manager, Carolyn? (who always has resting bitch face and no personality) if she could switch out the bread. I did not want her to change what was on the sandwich, just the bread. After returning with half of the items that were supposed to be on my sandwich and the correct bread, she asked me if this was correct. I told her it was incorrect and told her the correct things to put on my sandwich. This location is terrible and the employees/manager do not care about their job or customers.

I do have to admit that I am a bit of a sushi snob from being on the road so much but I would rather order sushi from publix than this place. Ordered a couple rolls and a couple pieces of tuna sashimi .The rolls were cut into very thin pieces and the taste and presentation were boring at best ,the tuna was the same yellow fin that I buy in a box at whole foods when preparing it seared.

I was fine since the money was going to be refunded to the Gift Card. I checked the card one week later and the balace was still unchaged, so I decided to contact the restaurant to see why the money wasn t receive in my gift card. I got in touch with The Manager Diego Morgan, and he said he will apply the $25 to any texas de brazil location, and he insisted that I call him before the reservation. Days passed and I received an offer from Texas de brazil for Memorial day and I wanted to take my wife since she is a Veteran.ISo on the 05/29/2016 I decided to call him to make the reservation for that date. I called Diego and i told him about the matter and he said that I cannot receive the $25 and get the offer on Memorial day, and I explained to him that I am not asking for a discount and that I was asking for A credit that was taken from my gift card, at that point I will not even need him to make the reservation I mean I have the right to go to any restaurant whenever I want with my gift card. So he told me to go ahead and make the reservation, which I did. Later on he called me stating that the matter was resolved and they are going to issue a gift card for $25, and that the only issue was that my current gift card was on hold (probably from checking it in their system too many times). Last Communication he wanted me to send him a picture of the voucher, which I did, But the matter didn''t got resolve.  Last communication with Diego was to contact corporate about the matter and fix with him and he just basiclly came back on his word about the $25 credit. i called corporate next day left 3 messages, never heard from him, Called Diego left a message but never got back to me. 05/31/2016 I called Corporate and I got hold of and explained her the issue with my gift card and she said that since the gift card wasn t purshased through them, i should contact the third party. I contacted the third party same day and explained the situation and they said that they will refund the amount on the gift card but since the gift card was purshased with a discount the same discount would be applied to the remaining balance, Which is fair. So I decided to get the refund since we missed the dinner with wife and all this issues that I incured.  I called the same day the restaurant Got Hold of Paula second manager over there and explained to her the situation, she gave me the apologies and came back to me with the same answer: we will gave you a discount if you come back, I explained to got a refund for my gift card and I wasn tplanning to come back over there and that they are holding $25 of my money. her last answer was to call the Corporate! \n",

            "We have been here a couple of times. The service is alright. The food is good. Tonight, we decided to order delivery and wait time is 1 hour to 1.5 hour. That is a bit ridiculous since we live 10 mins away from this place. We called them after the order was not delivered they had no record of the order from \"grubhub\" which is the online site to order food. Now we have to call them for refund because rice bowl does not get the money right away. What a waste of time. \n",

            "Decided Nicks for a pasta dinner, was originally excited however that quickly changed when my food arrived, the food was awful! Pasta was overcooked, bread burnt, chicken Parmesan looked and tasted as if were in the freezer forever, overpriced for quality of food and service, would not recommend this place to anyone.\n",
            "Asked for a BLT, but without the onions (as it shows on the menu, weird) \"we cannot do substitutions in the month of October\" weird, but ok no problem. I will get the Turkey club (showing on the menu sans onions). Turkey club comes - WITH ONIONS. did not bother saying anything, fine. Whatever. \n",

I get that the town definitely has an influx of people right now but that is just the most bizarre off putting thing ever. ESPECIALLY considering the fact that there were maybe 5 other tables and a few scattered people at the bar. Also the music was BLARING. \n",
            "\n",

            "I love P-Terry's!! I had such high hopes for Taco Ranch. But these guys should have stuck to burgers. I finally got to try it out today. I ordered two cheese and chicken quesadillas, a chicken taco salad, guacamole and quest. I will start with the quesadillas. Both of them had all of the meat piled into the very middle in a huge mound. Also the chicken was very dry and bland. So essentially I got 1/3 chicken quesadilla and 2/3 cheese quesadilla. The taco salad had the same dry bland chicken, no flavor what so ever. The beans in it were also very bland. Aside from that it was your pretty standard in every lettuce and diced tomatoes. And onto the dressing... a very important part of any salad. I ordered the ranch. No where did it say that it was spicy ranch but it lit my mouth up.i tasted nothing of the herbs you normally get from ranch, just cayenne.  I am really glad I tried it before giving a bite to my 1 year old daughter. While waiting for my food Luke asked if we would like any salsa. I told him would like the regular red salsa. This was also very spicy. I only assumed it would not be since they also offered a spicy red salsa. The queso was good. The guacamole did not have a whole lot of flavor but had big chunks of avocado, onion and tomato which I like in a guacamole. Over all I would say skip and stick to Torchy's or Taco Deli for tacos. I will still support them by enjoying P-Terry's, they have got a good thing going there.\n",

            "order was placed over phone put on hold for about 3 min before order was taken. with this I thought the place would be packed, odd being as it was a Tuesday night. food was ready in less then the 5 min it took me to get there, not that surprising being as there were only 5 people in the place. Major issue was it took 5 min to find the bar tender to pay the bill M.I.A.. When she did show she could not find my ticket, once she did she gave her self a $.70 tip no big deal just thought I got to chose how much I tip. Now to the Food it was as expected cold by the time I got back home, I live very close. chicken was cooked much earlier in the day very dry. I will go back to qdoba from now on.\n",
            "Asked to swap out pita chips for fruit due to gluten.  I was given a thimble of fruit, literally half a strawberry and two cubes of melon and was charged $3.  I complained to manager and was told the pita was a garnish and the server should have told me so and would not wave the charge.  I will not go back.\n",
            "This restaurant serves what I like to call LQF, or low quality food. It is loaded with salt and not very tasty but will fill you up fast and leave you with slight indigestion. The only good thing I can say is that the chips and salsa were decent. From there, the food quality declined substantially.\n",
            "Not sure about anything else, but they sure as hell do not know how to cook salmon.  I asked for it cooked medium and it came out gooey on the inside. I had to send it back FOUR times and it still was not right. It is possible that the quality they get is just that shitty, but the manager had an attitude and tried to tell me that is what medium looks like and I should have ordered medium well.  They did comp my meal but still not impressed. Never going back. Neither are my co-workers.\n",

            "The place was nearly empty when we arrived, but we still waited close to 10 minutes to he seated and then another 10 or so to be acknowledged by the server. It took her another 10 minutes to bring us water. \n",

            "This was almost the worst meal we ever had! We spent$160 in food for 3 adults. My salmon was burnt, the steak consisted of 5 small slices, the sole was greasy and tastless. We actually made comment to waitress about the small over done serving of steamed spinach and mushrooms, she very gladly made us another serving which turn out to be so salty it was unedible. Usually we would have complained but our feeling was they just did not get it\n",
            "First time here from H-Town on vacation but the service ( Michelle  ) was very nice an attentive. But the food needs improvement. Came on a advertisement 10 % off coupon each meal we paid about $14 per meal w/drink mac n' cheez looked as if they put plain macaroni in a bowl threw some cheese on it an zapped it in the microwave to heat the cheese which was overheated an crummy presentation. I think we will head back to Texas where our food is MUCH BETTER.\n",
            "Never actually got to eat there. They cancelled our reservation 30 min before we were supposed to arrive, after receiving a confirmation email on our reservation just 2 days before. How rude! \n",

            "To start off with there is a really cocky waiter at this place. He acts like he is doing you a favour by taking the order. This is by far the worst Indian restaurant you could step into. Food quality bad. You get the naan 45 mins after your done with your meals. If you ask them for spicy food it would be just full of chillies. N if you ask for less spicy it would be full of tomatoes. They keep you waiting. I would not even give this place one star. Do not ever step in here . There r better Indian places with courteous staff.\n",

NEVER - go to this Yard House. I have not been this sick from food in years and I have an iron stomach! Dam you Yard House for destroying my guts and mothers day !!!?Read the other one star reviews and that is echoed over and over. It makes me sad that the new Battery and none of the restaurants seem ready to serve correctly and timely. The Yard House hozed the apps and did not them out before the meal. Eggs were mushy and chips and guacamole came out like 20 minutes after the main course. These should be super easy and ready to serve without issue. Let us hope everyone gets it together soon or locals will NEVER support the beautiful investment of the new Battery.  Other than getting ultra sick and bad service slippery floors and just not a good meal. Nope. Nothing good to say.\n",
            "Oba, Oba, Oba, I am sorry to say , but I was I was invited by some friends when I was in town to meet at Oba, I was apprehensive, but thought I would give it another try...OMG nothing has changed same watered down drinks, and when the server walked by with Fish,  you could SMELL it, that is never a good sign.\n",
            "We had Dinner there, The food though beautifully plated, was substandard at best, you can always tell when a restaurant is having problems, they use 3rd to 4th rate lettuce, vegetables , meat , etc.  and I think this is the case.\n",
            "I wish them well, but do not try to disguise poor quality food, and get top dollar... not ethical!  I have dined at the best,  Sorry Oba, you need to step up to the plate, Portland has some of the best restaurants in the Country, TRY HARDER\n",
            "Horrible place! Hotel gave us a 10% off so we went there. We gave the coupon to our server right when we sat down. When the bill came at the end she told us the coupon was not valid for what we ordered. If you like dealing with used car salesman this is a great place to go!\n",

            "It was a weekday, early for dinner but when we walked in the front doors my first instinct was to walk (no run) straight back out again. Very, very loud music was being blasted from overhead speakers and it felt like we had just entered a nightclub instead of a nice restaurant. A young women (from the Claim Jumpers required 'listening for dinning' soundtrack)  was screeching \"Let me go crazy on you, I will go crazy crazy on you!\" over and over.\n",

            "I again expressed concern, especially for our two year old having his little toddler developing auditory system assaulted over the course of his meal. And the fact it was just difficult to carry on any kind of conversation.\n",
            "Both the hostess and waitress said they would \"ask\" to have the music turned down, but really they maybe obliged by a couple of decibel levels. By now, feeling we are becoming a nuisance\n",
            " my daughter suggested, let us just try and tune it out and get some food in our systems.\n",
            "Also, at this point it seemed like too much work to leave, get the two year old back in car seat, and drive around to looking for another restaurant.\n",

            "To all the dear people out there in need of a meal, spare yourselves this experience. Unless you have fairly low culinary standards (no shame in that, in fact it is kind of a curse at times to have high expectations) and if you do not mind listening to someone else's play list at top volume....which brings me to question Claim Jumper, are your very loud musical selections for the benefit of your staff or your customers?\n",
            " Musical taste is such a personal and varied aspect of individual personalities. Why not err on the side of graciousness and hospitality when selecting what your dinners are forced to listen to?\n",
            "I had a horrible experience here unfortunately. I came in and was told 45 minutes to get seated, almost two hours later we were finally seated. The waitress told us we had to order in two minutes as the kitchen closed at 11 and we were seated at 10:56. We arrived at the restaurant at around 8:50. My boyfriend and I ordered the steak and asked for it well done.. it came rare.\n",
            "Just to provide a frame of reference, some of the restaurants that I do like in Boston are Oleana, Namaskar, Christophers (for a burger and beer), India Quality. Now, about Martsa: This is one of the worst meals I have ever had in this town -- actually, make that ever! I do not understand why the place got good reviews or why it was packed when we went. It is absolutely horrible: almost everything, including their \"special sauces\" was recognizable as basic hot or sweat sauce from a can; all meat in meat dishes was stringy and tough, the dishes like oyster sauce over vegies and chicken is basically bottled oyster sauce dumped over the dish, chicken curry was tasteless mush.... need I go on. Oh yeah, their special teas are watery tea with some butter or a lot of milk and the chai is the store bought chai bags. I have been to Tibet, and I have been to China. I know what the real thing is and this is far far from it. Avoid it. Go to Namaskar or even better, India Quality.\n",
            "If I could zero stars I would. Asked for pizza extra well done. Raw mushrooms. Raw onions and no sauce. Would have rather eaten a baby hippos diaper after a day in the river. Little Caesar's is gourmet compared to this.\n",
            "Very bad service specially a lady we received from. Went there to try dosa buffet and while we were waiting for the table after paying for the food we ordered, she gave us food in plates asking us to eat it while standing and waiting. Upon telling her that we cannot eat while standing instead of helping us getting table she said she cannot help us and we will have to eat like that and it is our problem. Wrong attitude and tone towards customers during busy hours.\n",
            "Do not go here - worst service in the world. This place is ran by a bunch of bafoons/kids. We were asked to leave because the server thought we were too drunk after slipping and falling. They took our drinks, cut our game off and charged us. After we asked for an explanation, the manager (mike) would not give us one. It resulted in a physical altercation with 5 bouncers jumping me. My iPhone was smashed, watch is broken, cuts and bruises all over my body and no one was willing to provide their name or the name of their manager. A cop had to remove the bouncers off me and gave me his officer number as a witness to press charges. There is no accountability for what goes on here or how this dump is managed. I recommend Kings.\n",
            "Food was great! But horrible service, first they skipped our turn to be seated claimed they called us but we were sitting in front of the desk the whole time. They never assigned us a waiter so we had to ask someone to help us after sitting for 20 mins just to get coffee. Food took another 30 mins to arrive and it was wrong. No one ever checked on us, we arrived at 11am it is not 1:40 now leaving very upset\n",
            "Alright for me to rate a restaurant a 1 is not easy but my god this restaurant is absolutely RIDICULOUS. I went with my girlfriend for dinner 5/31/16. Before I went I read the reviews and I heard a lot about bad customer service. I was like whatever so long as I get my food I will be satisfied. As soon as we walked into the restaurant it was empty we were the only ones there. There was no one up front to seat us it took them a solid 5 minutes for someone to seat us. Then I took a seat it is an expensive restaurant so I put on some fancy clothes. Our waitress comes over and she does not give us any plates forks and etc till we asked for it. When she brought me my drink she spilled the entire thing on me and my expensive outfit. I was really mad but I was like whatever accidents happen. Next our meal I told the waitress I Am allergic to pork so what would you suggest that does not have pork in it and she said the Pollo Al Mattone and she said there was no pork. And what happens there is pork in it. I was absolutely done. I would never go to this restaurant I do not recommend it at all. To top it all off the bill came out to be 105. I will not complain about the money but to spend that much money and have the worst experience yea do not bother going there. Worst customer service.\n",

My sister and I got the classic chicken sandwich, the single cheese burger, onion rings, fries, hot pepper poppers and chicken poppers. Let Us start with the chicken which was very dry and the bread was stale. all the sides were disappointing! even the french fries were very salty!\n",

            "Never coming back again.\n",
            "We were so disappointed the last few times we went to Hyde Park Grill.  We used to be such fans and would go all the time, especially to brunch on Sundays.  The service has really done down hill and it seems they changed their ingredients to lower quality fare.  We waited over an hour for two salads, a cup of soup, and a turkey burger about a month ago.  Last week had a waiter that seemed put out to wait on tables, even though that is his job.  Though we did not try the fries, the fried mushrooms were spongy and the chicken fried chicken was very greasy.  We will not be coming back here anytime soon.  Will stick with Threadgill's or Hoover's for home cooking.\n",
            "Room was not cleaned every day or it seemed to be partially done and the container for shampoo never got filled until I asked for it.  Not even the toilet paper was replenished when it was almost all gone.  Tuesday night of my stay I brought laundry down in a bag and gave it to the front desk clerk.  The next night I still had not received it back so I went down to look for it. I had a copy of my pink laundry slip.  Front desk clerk was rude (noticed this previously) but said she would look for it.  Said she could not find it - then I notice a laundry bag right next to the door behind the desk where I assume the offices were and guess what??  My laundry from the night before!  Never got submitted.  Desk clerk with not one ounce of empathy said \"well if you have a problem I will call the manager\" which I requested she do.  Manager said he is not sure what happened (no apology) but will give me change so I can do the laundry (I was at a convention so needed specific shirts and pants for the show).  So I stayed up and did laundry until late.  Most of the front desk staff except for Angie (the Filipino girl) were rude and I saw a couple of them getting in arguments with other customers.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS HOTEL and we have conventions in Orlando all the time.  I will also mention total unacceptability of hotel to convention organizers.    I have been at Sheratons all across the nation and this particular one will leave a very bad taste for a very long time!!\n",
            "Oh boy, had I wished I did not ignore all the warning signs about this place. My friends and I had just finished playing in a dodgeball tournament at OSU and were hungry, so we went for a bite to eat. It was \"rush hour\" in the restaurant world and every place was packed, with the exception of good old Cluck-you-chicken. Literally, there was nobody there (this was warning sign number 1). Completely ignoring the fact that nobody was eating there and there were flies everywhere in the restaurant, we decided to go in anyway. \n",

We looked at the menu for at least a good five minutes before (presumably) the only employee working comes out from behind the counter to take our order. We all order and then go grab a table. While we are waiting on our food one of my friends went to the restroom to wash his hands. He comes out of the restroom pale, and when we ask him what is wrong, he says the restroom smells like death and he almost vomited (warning sign number 3... when they do not even bother to clean the areas that you see, imagine what the kitchen looks like). I also go to the rest room to wash my hands and I can certainly confirm, there must have been a dead body stashed somewhere in there. There were also a good amount of empty beer cans in the trash can. \n",

They had a mushy-breading on them, and it was not mushy because the sauce made it that way, no, it was mushy because the oil they were fried in was not hot enough. I ordered the sauce on my wings the second-hottest that they had. However when I tasted my wings, the sauce was not hot at all. It had more of a sweet flavor to it, which was an incredible disappointment, because, well, I like my wings hot. If I wanted sweet sauce, I would have got to a Chinese place and ordered sweet and sour chicken. \n",

            "I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it.  The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n",
            "\n",
            "The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they do not have trays so she could not carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I cannot imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway.  I get it is not the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you do not want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.\n",
            "A 1-star not because of the food, but the service.  Food was ok.  However, when I went to pay (you have to go to the register - the wait staff does not deal with the bill) I approached the register with my card-in-hand.  I stood there as a young girl was counting money and ignoring my presence.  After a few minutes of waiting, and not being acknowledged, she took the money she was counting and left . . . with no comment.  She returned a few minutes later and took my card and ran the check.  She gave me the receipt to sign . . . still without saying anything to me.  I signed it and left - without a \"thank you for coming\" or a \"how was your breakfast\" or \"get the heck out of here\" from her.  Will I return - doubtful.  Plenty of friendly breakfast spots in Portland with a touch of customer service.  (It was the short girl with the nose piercing - not that either of those matter, but as a means to identify her should the manager wish to take some positive action.  I find the manager as much at fault as the girl - she should have been trained as to how to interact with customers.  I wonder which other managerial functions are being neglected?)\n",

Our family policy is that we do not spend money at establishments that charge a \"mandatory gratuity\" - WE decide if the service is good/bad/whatever.  The tab for this meal was promising to top $400.00 - the service had better be impeccable.  Nowhere on the website or online menu was there a notice of \"18% mandatory gratuity\" - like other Portland eateries with this policy, they like to engage in ambush tactics - they wait until you show up, and the notice is either given verbally or in No.7 font at the bottom of the menu...banking on the fact that, once there, you will not leave.  Unacceptable and unprofessional.  \n",

However, the last four times I have gotten chicken wings here they have been teeny tiny, with barely any meat on them and either soggy if I do not ask for crispy or overly fried and dry if I ask for crispy (I think this is because there is so little meat on the bone!). Also, they do not let you mix and match flavors with a 10 piece which I think is ridiculous, I am the kind of girl who likes some variety in her life. Hey, at least they are consistent. \n",

I have never dealt with rude service at a Vietnamese restaurant before until this visit. I always get Bun Bo Hue at Pho places. My bowl came out and the broth was clear (bun bo hue's broth is kind of murky with red oils). I was hesitant to taste but I did. The broth might has well have been tap water. The bowl had an abundance of meats and noodles though. I asked for shrimp paste and chili oil (which is regularly served with the dish). She asked if I really needed it and insisted on me retasting my soup.I did just to appease and still put in the request. 5 mins later she comes back with only the shrimp paste and I asked for the chili. She left to retrieve it and asked if I needed anything else (as if my requests were out of this world). Its safe to say this will be my first and last time here. I could have turned the other way with the rude service (she could have had a bad day) but there is no excuse for flavorless food.\n",

            "Belly Rule #1: always make way fewer of everything than customers are expecting so  you can consistently disappoint them. For example: make only one or two of every kind of of bagel. That way you can show customers that you are capable of creating something, but will most certainly not be able to deliver.\n",
            "\n",
            "Belly Rule #2: while we strive to not have enough bagels, sides or toppings, do not tell the customer this when they order. Make sure to tell the customer at the last possible moment that you are out of their food items. This will maximize wait time and inconvenience. \n",
            "\n",
            "Belly Rule #3: smiles are not allowed. In fact, try not to look at the customer when they are ordering. our store is very small and we just cannot afford to have customers coming back - there is not enough room.\n",
            "\n",
            "Belly Rule #4: Argue with your co-workers in front of customers. This is mandatory. Let Us be honest, you should not even be here today and its totally the bagel prep guy's fault.\n",
            "\n",
            "Belly Rule #5: improvise. If you see an opportunity to inconvenience, disappoint, or generally turn what could be a wonderful, quaint, delicious little bagel and sandwich shop into a soul-less, rude, bland purveyor of mediocrity, please do not hesitate.\n",

            "This place has got a lot of work to do. We will not be back until I see some decent reviews on here. Really a shame, we were pretty excited about this place opening up. From start to finish our experience was disappointing. We had a party of 7 and were crowded into a table for 6 when the restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of open tables. When we asked to sit elsewhere, the hostess made it seem like a big enough deal and inconvenience that we ended up just conceding and asking for another chair. Service was slow. So slow. Again, the restaurant was not busy, and yet it took forever to sit, order, receive our drinks, receive our food. And the food was terrible. Absolutely awful. With 7 people, we ordered 3 appetizers and 7 different pizzas, calzones, etc. Only one person had anything good to say, and it was for the soup of the day which was Italian wedding. See pictures for the burnt garbage the rest of us were served. Lipstick on the wine glasses. Failure to sell wine by the bottle. The whole thing reeks of bad management. It was way overpriced, the food was burnt and a lot of it tasted distinctly sour. That is the only descriptor word for I have for it. I really hope this place gets it together. It is a lovely location with a wonderful patio. Unfortunately, we are crossing it off our list of places to go.\n",

Prior to ordering, we notified our server that we had a travelzoo voucher so that he could better accomodate us if there was a limited menu.  He replied that they required a paper copy of the voucher as per their \"company policy\".  This was not written anywhere on the travelzoo voucher and our travelzoo voucher was even mentioned when we booked the reservation over the phone.  At no point was their requirement for a hard copy of the voucher mentioned.\n",

There are dozens of places in Winter Park that I would rather spend my hard earned money.\n",

Had to make several phone calls the day after to get it settled. Manager would only refund $50, so I ended up paying $15 per shot when regular cocktails are less than that. Food was horrible and overpriced and service is horrendous at night. Never again. Save your money, go somewhere else. There is nothing special here.\n",

The unmatured korean servers do not know what their doing nor has a knowledge of the menu of what their serving. The place is packed for a reason I could not figure out. Do not order Sundae bbokeum, and greenonion fried chicken. They are the worst korean food listed in my life.

Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around.

            "I have waited to do this review with the hopes that the service and food might improve at Alamo, but neither have happened so here goes. I have strongly disliked Alamo since they changed their booking system, forcing you to buy tickets online if you want a decent seat next to your friends and then charging you a \"booking fee\" for doing so. This always felt shady to me. Anyway you look at it their food is over priced and is less then mediocre. The service has always been poor. Back in September we ordered the queso fries and by accident and we were served fries with bacon on it. We are both vegetarian. This may not have been a big deal if we were able see the fries, but we were served in the dark and did not realize there was bacon until our first bite. I immediately called for the waiter who is only response was \"so do you not want it?\"\n",
            "Last week we came in and after an hour of waiting inquired about my grilled cheese sandwich that never showed up. I then received a lukewarm grilled cheese sandwich with the excuse \"kitchen was backed up.\" No apology. I was then charged for the lukewarm sandwich and I was so sick of dealing with them I did not argue. Next day I made online complaints for both incidents, but it has now been 2 weeks with no response. It is obvious that Alamo is so big now that they could care less about the quality of their product or their customers. Not that it will make a difference, but I will no longer give my money to Alamo.\n",
            "Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Lazy emoloyees stay in the back and try to look \"busy\" while they have one employee on the front line. Food is not the freshest.

She had made eye contact, so I knew we she was listening. I was shocked that she just walked away from me in the middle of me talking. She then went to the register to help someone. I have never had this happen in my life!!! I informed another server that I wanted to be moved.  I told the new server the situation and where I was moving, she did not apologize or bring my water from my previous table. All around bad service. I heard music blaring from the kitchen too, which greatly conflicted with the country music that was playing on the overheard speakers.\n",

After waiting longer than expected the delivery guy called and said he was at our place (he was not)  He would been given the incorrect address from the order taker.  I told him the correct specific address.  He said he knew right were we were and would be right over.  After wtg. longer than it would take to get from where he was to my home, we got a call from a manger to verify the address again.  He said he would be here in 2 minutes.  Again, after wtg. much longer than 2 minutes, we decided to give them a call.  I spoke with a different manager who told me were are outside there delivery range.  Seriously?

Was getting late and when I asked to cancel the order, this person flatly refused. Not even a \"I am afraid we cannot do that. Sorry\". Just \"NO\".

            "Croma re-opened two nights ago....that being said, the staff was doing the best they could do.  My friend and I went for a quick bite after running an errand on Newbury.  We happened to walk by Croma, the patio was busy, but not too busy, and they had a table outside available for us.  Once we sat down, we heard the hostess tell everyone else who came by that the menu they had displayed was not what they were serving.  They were only serving a limited menu.  Would have been nice to know before we sat down.  My friend ordered a fruit plate and I ordered a soup and salad.  Our food came fairly quickly which was appreciated.  The tomato basil soup was great.  I ordered a cup and was brought out a bowl.  The caesar salad was just ok - nothing special.  The fruit plate was so pitiful -  an embarrassment for the restaurant.  The $10 or $12 fruit plate (I cannot remember), consisted for four inedible strawberries (if they opened the day before you think they would have the freshest fruit), a few slices of apple, some grapes, ritz type cracker and 10 slices (some of them I would barely call slices) of cheese.  When someone came by and asked how our food was, we pointed out the fruit plate.  She came back later to say she told the chef and he said he was sorry and \"hoped we would come back\".  Needless to say, we will not be back.\n",
            "It was my hope, since BeFit bills itself as a health food restaurant, that everything would be fresh and nothing would be processed, but that was not my experience. On our arrival, we found four friendly young men (very friendly...their loud banter echoed off the walls the whole time we were there) who, though employees, knew next to nothing about the restaurant. \"We are new,\" they laughed, as if that excused 1. Being out of quinoa, 2. Not knowing what soups were available, 3. When asked about the potato soup, could not say what was in it, and 4. Being out of essential smoothie ingredients. Not an promising beginning, but we ordered. Salad, soup, and tea for me; sandwich, fruit, and smoothie for my friend. \n",
            "The sandwich and fruit came first: a sad-looking meal, unadorned, on a red plastic plate. I do not know what was in the sandwich, but the fruit, seved in a tiny plastic cup with a plastic seal (obviously not made fresh), looked suspiciously like canned fruit cocktail. \n",
            "My salad consisted of chopped lettuce, obviously from a bagged grocery store mix, topped with little chicken dices (picture Tyson frozen chicken strips, cut up) shredded carrots, and a drizzle of Thai dressing. And the potato soup, OMG. Served in a styrofoam cup with a tiny plastic spoon, it consisted of potato chunks and shredded carrot in a lukewarm, watery base. I can attest to it is not being freshly made because I saw it come  out of a freezer in commercial packaging. I still shudder  when I think of it. \n",

We wanted to order more during the meal but nobody seemed to care so we decided against it. Had this been my first time here, I would also be confused as to where to pay because no one informed me that I have to go up to the front, or even how much my bill was. Needless to say, zero tip. Why should I pay for service I did not receive? Next time I will go to the food court - same shit with a little friendlier customer service.\n",

In summary, the food is good enough (say 2-3 stars), but it is not good enough to endure the wait, and the poor and surly service, every time (zero stars)!  Why do we keep going there?!

I asked the lady and she seemed very hesitant/walking away. Through her tiny burps (she had just finished eating), she told us that the only wings available now were the sand-blasted ones and it was hard to understand her because she had a bit of trouble saying sand-blasted. So she just pointed to the photos. We really did not like the environment there as the smell of smoke was still lingering and possibly quite fresh, we decided to go.\n",

            "I visit Atlanta once or twice a year and always enjoy looking for new places to bring the laptop, have a latte and get some work done.  This time, based on consistently positive reviews, I decided to try out Octane.  I arrived to find a nice, open space with a cool vibe, but all went downhill from there.  I ordered a latte and a bowl of soup, paid and went to my table.  It took almost fifteen minutes to get the latte, which was beautiful, but for me, undrinkable.  Even though it came in a small glass so the ration of espresso to milk should have been high, the coffee taste was too weak for my taste.   It was barely above room temperature and had a slightly sour aftertaste.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Then the roasted tomato soup arrived.  It, too, was barely warm, was also dramatically underseasoned.  I love a good tomato soup, but as tomatoes are so high in acid, they need something to balance that and add freshness.  The soup at Octane had a one-note, sour tomato taste -- no herbs, no sweetness, no balance.  To this point, I was willing to consider that my taste and that of the chef were simply different -- it happens, but then it got worse.  I took the soup up to the counter to let them know it was not hot and also told them I did not really like the taste.   The woman I spoke to seemed surprised, but asked if I wanted to try something else.   I chose the quiche and she told me it would take a few minutes to warm up, which I said was fine.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, when the quiche arrived, it had the same problems as the soup.  It was ice cold in the middle and had a one-note, unbalanced flavor profile.  The server who brought me the quiche carefully avoided asking me if it was okay, so after several attempts to get her attention, I carried the plate up to the counter to tell her that the quiche was cold and her response was \"that is impossible.\"  While she is entitled to her opinion, I believe that one of the worst things a server can do is tell a patron that his/her experience invalid, so I found this quite annoying.  At that point I wanted to leave and just accept that Octane was not a place for me, but then the server had her manager came out.   The manager said she wanted to help, but when I told her my concerns, she told me that they always make things the same way -- which was not particularly helpful or responsive, and when I told her that I felt the server's comments were dismissive, she told me that she was sure that was not what the other woman meant -- again denying my experience of what had happened.\n",

The chicken was way too salty, very pricy, and both sauces I got (avocado salsa and ranch) were too salty, or over seasoned, too.

We picked this place since it was close to our hotel in FL and we did not know any better. The rice for the sushi was all wrong - packed hard and just not made properly.  I asked the sushi chef what was good today and he said tuna and salmon. The fish was not quality and with the wrong rice, I was concerned about freshness. \n",

The only thing that is half way decent is the baked beans. I got a gallon of sweet tea and I am just too scared to try it.  I try not to go by other people's  reviews, but in this case I should have. Unfortunately, I did not pick up the food because I would not had paid the amount of money my husband did and I would have left it right there.  I will pay good money for decent barbecue, but this was no where near worth it. Shame on you guys for selling dry meat. If you call yourselves barbecue pit-masters then you would know not to sell dry meat to the public. Five thumbs down..\n",

            "As I walked into the silver skillet my stomach was craving for a good meal. I walked into the frigid cold diner, and took a seat. The server came and asked what my sister, brother, and I would like to drink. I ordered a coffee. My brother ordered a sweet tea, while my sister ordered a cranberry juice. She brought our beverages a few moments later, and asked what we would like to eat. I ordered a smoked turkey omelet expecting it to fulfill my hunger. By this time my coffee was almost gone. Our server came back with a scorching hot coffee pot, while I was on my cellular device. She reached over me with the burning hot coffee pot, which crossed over my face with intensified heat, unexpectedly. The heat of the coffee pot scared me so, that I jerked my arm trying to shield myself from it. In doing so my coffee spilled on me. After this incident all the server said was sorry, and went to get me another one. Eventually my food arrived, and I started eating. Midway through eating I noticed something particular in my omelette. I look down and noticed that there were mushroom in it. The original meal was not supposed to have mushrooms. I am allergic to mushrooms. Immediately I called the server back over, and she said that she would get me another. She did not even care about me being allergic to it. The whole experience was bad. Their manager was not even there. So basically here were chickens running around with their heads cut off. I would rank this a good 1 out of 5 stars. I would never go here again. The food is bad, and so is the service. Even Waffle House is better, which is where we should have gone if we were going to get that type of food.\n",

            "we ate here with my 4 year old son and it was horrible. We ordered crawfish, shrimp, and clams and the crawfish were so small there was no meat. the sauce was not sauce it was like salty/spicy powder. the corn on the cob was about 1\" long and overcooked and mushy. we ordered sausage with the \"pot\" aka plastic bag of grossness and never got it and the waitress said we did not order it when I clearly heard my mom order it. The waitress was rude. There is NO kids menu. she told me to order him a 9.00 meal of chicken strips because that was the only option there was. 9.00 for a kids meal is too expensive I feel and probably would have been too much food. I asked for teriyaki sauce for my son and the waitress laughed at me and said they did not have any. no drink refills; she did not even come by to check on us and the place was EMPTY. My aunt paid for the whole awful lunch while we were washing our hands and the bill seemed really steep so I asked the waitress for a detailed receipt and she has double charged us for 2 items plus...   too expensive and not good.\n",
            "Well, tried to talk to John the manager about the grat added to my to go tab.  He was very unhelpful.  So I guess the plan is: if you have a drink with friends do not order your to go at the table.

I just phoned to take them up on that, and I was told there was no credit in their system for me. I am too failed by this location. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business. SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY! Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable. A free side order? Not good enough! I am a disabled,  housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today. I have never experienced such deplorable service from Domino's. I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts.  I will never do business with you again. I am writing corporate as well. I do not taken being mistreated well. It is unacceptable!\n",
            "Visited to spend a gift card I received and everything about my experience was absolutely awful. The hostess looked like she hated her job and did not talk to us. Our server obviously did not want to be serving us, either. She never smiled and was very short with all of her questions. She never once came to refill our drinks and when I tried to complain about my pizookie (I got the churro pizookie but it tasted like onions) she refused to stop at our table. The evening came to an end by her basically tossing the bill at our table and not even stopping to ask how our dinner was. This was my first and last time visiting BJ's.\n",
            "Definitely not worth the price. I order the 6 strips and fries, ended up walking out with a 6 things that look like they maybe related to chicken strips and corn \"salsa\", because I was waiting for over ten minutes for fries. My strips were dry, cold and chewy, definitely not a good first impression. Corn Salsa... more like faux corn salsa (canned corn with some green and red specks of something).

            "Some time ago I stopped ordering from the restaurant because the food was very sour. A few months ago, after getting an in-person visit from the restaurant (found it a bit creepy) and being reassured there was a new cook I gave the place another chance. All was great until today when I accidentally found my order sitting in front of my house. I asked everybody inside if they heard anybody knocking or ringing the bell. Everyone, including the dogs, heard nothing. When I called the restaurant to ask what happened they told me they only call on the phone to drop off the food and since I did not answer my phone they left the food by the door. I am not a teenage girl glued to my phone, sorry. They said many people want to be only called on the phone when the food arrives. Well, great. I did not want to be only called. I did not restrict contact to phone only. When I said it was not cool to leave the food in front of the house they hang up on me.\n",
            "This is the worst Indian food I have ever had in my life... and I have eaten a lot of Indian food. I ordered the butter chicken. The sauce was good but the chicken itself was a bit bland. None of the flavour was in the chicken for some reason, just in the sauce. The 8 oz. serving was served in a cup. I feel like it was less than 8 oz. Anyway, you got very little butter chicken for $9. It came with rice or naan. The naan was not actually good. I would prefer to stick to the places that actually cook their naan the traditional way (as opposed to rubbery microwaved pita bread). You know you are at a rip-off Indian takeout when you run out of curry before naan. I am used to the opposite. Overall, small servings, bad naan, dried out and flavourless chicken. The only reason to eat here is if everything else around is closed and you do not like Chinese food (which is how I found myself here). I would avoid this place. You are better off at Pita Pit around the corner where you get more food for less money and it is pretty decent for fast food.\n",

            "I have been to this location a couple of times, the service has never been great but I have come back for the good food. This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I am pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I do not know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This would not have been a big deal if it had not taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.\n",

When I brought this to the attention of the blonde female bartender that I placed my order with she told me that she had already given me my drink. After telling her that was not the case(she had given a margarita to the group of African American ladies 5-10ft to my right but not to me) she decided I had at some point walked away from the bar which was also not true(the people waiting on me thought I had left during this interlude). At this point she tried to ignore me and assist other customers. It is one thing to be given bad service but it is infuriating to be blamed for the bad service and ignored. It seemed like a nice place but the customer service was irredeemable. I could not in good conscience recommend this establishment to anyone else with this experience in mind.\n",

As an oft-solo diner I usually sit at the bar; never the best experience but it beats sitting alone in the dining room like Steve Martin in a scene out of the 'Single Guy'. Still sitting at the bar can be awkward - especially when they are not doing a brisk business. The unwritten rule of bartenders is you take good care of people who are eating by themselves. So on this slow weekday evening - I am the only person at the bar and the only one having dinner. There are three - count  them three - guys working the bar. I might as well have been invisible. First, they have decided to take inventory of the bar...two of them have their back to me counting bottles while a third is handling dining room orders and socializing with the wait staff which is always bad form. At one point, one of the bozo 'bottle-counters' takes a stapler and puts it on the bar right in front of me - the most bizarre thing I have ever witnessed in a restaurant. The whole thirty foot bar is wide open and this knucklehead decides to place a business-sized stapler from the register six inches from my plate. WTF? After this ridiculous, weird and anti-customer action, I decided no more.\n",

Little did we know that \"a couple minutes\" meant a half hour to this girl. Though we had folded our menus and placed them on the end of our table and had been smiling and looking at this waitress, she never came back over to take our order. She even passed our table several times where I would try and wave her down and she would ignore me. Is not was not until after my friend and I had watched her cash out several people and take the orders of two other tables did we decide to try and wave down the other waitress to send her over. We then witnessed the other woman pass our waitress without saying a word to her, so we got up and left without paying for our drinks. I have never in my life experienced such terrible service. I cannot even imagine how shitty they are over priced diner food would have tasted like.\n",

            "I have been to sushi-land/ville three times now-- the first time i decided to be brave and give the sketchy conveyor belt food a chance, the second time i was trying to be amicable with company, the third time I went with a friend who was craving sushi and a friend who had never had sushi and was very skeptical.   I am sad that this was her first experience of it!  I thought the food was kind of gross the first two times due to the fact that i see the same plates go round and round many times, and I do not think anyone regulates how long it stays on there.  The only reason I went back was because I was told you could order food fresh, so that made me feel a little better.  We ordered the seared salmon and whitefish fresh, those were ok.  Since eel is semi-cooked i thought it would be safe to grab from the belt, but no! mistake!  The only stuff i got off the belt was rolls that were vegetarian or only had a small amount of fish, all of which were mediocre at best.  And now, two days later, my digestions is not happy, and I blame sushi land!  I have also heard a rumor that there is been a sighting of fish left out in the hall at the one by PSU, and that is just not cool.  In conclusion, I think raw fish is best left to higher quality restaurants with chefs who take their work (i.e. sanitation practices) seriously.  This is one case where it is worth paying extra!\n",

Not only is their food ridiculously over-salted, so you will drink more and eat less, but it tastes even worse coming back up! Most of the beef that came by was overcooked as well.

On our last & final visit, we were very surprised that, after we got our food, the wait staff would start sweeping under tables and banging dust pans about. And I do not mean lightly or courteously- it was like they were in a race to get out of there. So all that dirt and dust is settling on our plates now. Not to mention very noisy and unprofessional. We got our meals to go and mentioned it to the management and he said that was their normal duties. Shocking! I suggest trying the numerous other Indian restaurants that have popped up in the last several years. G'raj Mahal is one. That place is pretty dang good and is downtown too.\n",

I arrived 5 min prior to my ready time and calIed. I waited for approximately 15 min when a young man came out and said my order would not be ready for another 15-20min. I asked why i was not told when I first arrived and why is the wait time so long now. He answered they got a rush after my order was placed.  I had 2 young children with me that were hungry (which is why we choose pick up).  As I was waiting another pick up order pulled in, went inside for 10-15 min and came out with their order. Their order ready time was 15min AFTER mine was quoted online. I finally received my order at 7:50 (50 minutes I waited in my car with starving children and no check up). I was not offered any comp for my wait so I asked to speak to the manager. Our order was cold, did not get extra fries until I pointed out I did not get what I specifically asked for and my order was wrong! I paid extra for avocado and did not get any in my wrap. It was my kids bedtime by the time we got our cold food and I had to demand a refund...which I still have yet to get.

Before it was a cool, mellow place to get happy hour food (salmon skewers, fries, salads etc.) for a good price. It had a cool ambiance too, with interesting lighting and live music on weekends. But now the menu's different and it is not worth going for. The whole concept seems to have shifted. Not good. So if you read the old reviews keep in mind that things have changed.\n",
            "Be careful we got sick. My wife had it worse from the fish tacos or the salsa. The salsa was also very poor quality and tasted old. We went here based on good reviews but there has not been any recent reviews. We will not ever go back. I think the health dept. needs to visit also. I ordered grilled chicken and it was okay but not anything I would want to order again. The chips for the salsa were also poor quality and tasted like flour instead of corn chips.\n",

When I got the pho, I stirred through it to find only 2 pieces of quarter-sized pieces of crab meat along with plenty fish and pork meat balls that was not listed in the description. I asked one server if I could please get something else. I realize there is a language barrier and he got someone else to help. Another server comes to the table. I apologize to him for the inconvenience and ask for something else. The look he gave me was very rude. He understood what I was asking but he offered no help until my friend offered to pay for the #54. When a paying customer is unsatisfied with an order they should not have to pay for that order. A different server brings me shrimp noodle soup instead and when I lifted the #54 bowl to give back to him her pointed at the table and said \"NO!\"  The table we were at was rather small and the extra bowl there was inconvenient.\n",

Of all the places in Portland, the town of great restaurants, we made the mistake of stopping here thinking that it was still good. Great wait staff and bar tender but the restaurant also had filthy restrooms; a sure sign of decline. Great view, drinks are OK but high priced. Too Bad, Farewell to a great restaurant.\n",

When I spoke to the servers and what appeared to be management, they said that its okay and understandable. However the door people came up and kicked me out saying that \"ONLY FEMALES ARE ALLOWED TO WEAR TANK TOPS\" this is a fucking joke. It is 2016, this is a sexist, disgusting, and disrespectful place for anyone to go. I wish I could give it zero stars. I plan on contacting a legal outlet to discuss if this is even okay to do. Also would like to mention that when I put my work shirt on, they said I could only come in if I got them a discount where I work. This is unethical and disgusting.\n",

You may think it is, but it is not. It is soul-less. What it is... is a venue to catch your favorite band during one of their few and far between stops in Boston. Nothing more. Oh... and the occasional Dropkicks show... but even they would be better suited in another venue.\n",

(For those who do not know, the Mezzanine is the second floor). Keep an eye out for the dreaded \"MEZZ\" printed on your ticket. When you arrive and find that you are curiously being herded upstairs... you will find that you cannot see. Plain and simple. You will not see your favorite band in this 7th pit of hell, after all. That is... unless you arrive early enough to secure a spot against the rail, then you will see them just fine. Just do not leave to get an overpriced drink or to use the bathroom, which is upstairs on the 3rd floor...conveniently located right next to a Foxwoods sign, just in case you forgot who brought you this fine establishment while you wait on line for the bathroom. You snooze, you lose. Do not walk away from your precious \"see-all\" location against the railing.  This location is all the more precious because about one third (1/3) of this \"awesome\" Mezz section is roped off and inaccessible unless you know the band... I repeat... unless you know the band. If I knew the band, I would want to be on stage, off to the side where I cannot be seen. Just saying.\n",

Will not be supporting this business any longer and will go out of my way to warn others of this half ass excuse for a breakfast spot.\n",
            "Most of the time I like to give great reviews, but unfortunately, I cannot for this place. The pizza was not all that bad, but the staff is the big problem. To be honest, it seemed like they would rather be hanging out with each other than focusing on customers. Our waiter was horrible. He was dressed like he was going to a construction site and he was inconsiderate and made us wait forever. His demeanor also bothered me, as he was walking around like he thought he was better than everyone else. All I can say is: get a new wait staff or this place will go under. From the looks of other reviews, most people feel the same way I do.\n",

            "This place as really gone down hill.  I used to come once a week with a friend for several years.  Returned for first time after 6 months and was very disappointed.  Servers were not friendly.  People across from us got in fight over rules about wings.  They ran out of our favorite tequilla. The food was fair (we usually get steak salad, cheese sticks).  Just stunning how bad an experience it was.  Maybe new management or owner?? This long time customer will not return.\n",
            "45 min and still waiting for my food.  This place has great reviews, but service was terrible tonight.  People that were seated after me got their food. Obviously kitchen is not organized.\n",
            "I really wish I could review their food - it sounds delish! However, we waited and waited and waited and were never seated. I guess children are not welcome at such a hip spot to dine. On a Sunday mid morning, we expected to wait to be seated at any eatery - but their first come first serve seating clearly does not apply to families. Many groups arriving after us we seated before we left, fed up with NO service. Very disappointed. We are happy to spread our money around, but never, ever again to Genie's.\n",
            "I would like to start with the good, and that would be the service, but how could it be bad when there is only 3 occupied tables during 7:30 dinner rush.  That alone set off alarm bells.  The dinner for 4 only cost 50 dollars!  That is cheap.   We ordered family style and they gave us a generous portion for two hungry kids and 2 adults.  Only problem was it was barely edible due to saltiness.  It happens.  No big deal.  The following morning we went there for breakfast and oh my goodness, 30 dollars per head for the buffet! The selection is your standard hotel breakfast buffet spread.   NOT WORTH IT!  One star because it was the very worst breakfast buffet.   For 30 dollars, someone ahould have been making table side omelettes.  No omelettes, just cold scrambled eggs.   How can breakfast cost 3 times as much as dinner?   Unless your desperate to eat and there is nothing else, avoid this place like the black plague.\n",
            "Ordered online- Got home home no chicken w/string beans. Called and (sounded annoyed that I was even asking, they were just rude) and they stated that I did not order. When I shared online receipt they said \"Oh we did not charge you for that anyway.\" They did. I had the receipt. I am a 20 year customer that will not be returning.\n",
            "First the waitress was nice.  We ordered wings and the waitress they rain out of ranch dressing, how do you run out of ranch!  After we waited 40 minutes for our food, the manager told us we the kitchen is behind about 1.5 hours. Also, he did know if they may not fully our order They should have told us how behind they truly was!   The food came out cool and not completely done.  My stomach hurts and I am on their toilet, you tell me.  Do not visit Never eat here, food is horrible\n",

Once we sat at our table, we waited for the server to come to our table for 15 minutes and then we decided to leave due to lack of service.

Went inside and had a peek at the wait list that was kept behind the desk and noticed that our name was crossed off and there were 7 other groups that were called after our name... I asked the gentleman about why our name was crossed off and his answer was definitely not one that you would expect in this situation. \n",

Here are the reasons why it took so long: 1) Cashier was chatting with friends while the line was building up 2) She did not put my shake in the order. Clearly not up to the standards of the other Which Wich shops I have been to in Texas. Top it off they did not toast it even though it was marked toasted.\n",
            "I ve come to this place 2 times so far and both times I had a very poor customer service experience. The first time the server was extremely slow and inattentive. The second time, they wanted to charge each person in our group a $10 cover because they had paid for direct tv to stream a game that was playing that night, which we were not interested in watching, and obviously we went to eat somewhere else. I am not planning to try going a third time.\n",
            "The review  is for the takeaway order phone in service which had me on the line for 20 minutes and then hung up.  When enquired, the local store mentioned that they had outsourced online orders to a 3rd party. There was no sense of apology fron the store. Makes me wonder if customer service is of imoortance here. Will follow up on food quality with a future review.\n",
            "Oh my. What can I say. Last night 2.12.16 was HORRIBLE! Got in and seated right away. Should a known. Hour later no food. Waitress said they have a lot of people waiting outside and a lot of take out. So that justifies making dining in customers wait on their food. Not once did a manager go to any table and apologize. One table finally got their food but something extra was in it. Do not know what it was. Sounds like poor management, scheduling and them helping in the kitchen.\n",
            "Worst place to get service.  There were two waiters and 6 people at the bar and it took 25 min to take our food order.  Then the server rolled her eyes at me because I was annoyed at how long it took to order a burger.  Awful!\n",
            "I really wanted to like The Coop. The idea of tasty Southern food was really appealing. Unfortunately, my meal did not live up to my expectations. You have to order your food cafeteria style at the counter and when I ordered my mashed potatoes green beans and chicken they labeled up this mashed potatoes from the steam table put them on the plate and just waited for the rest of my food to come My plate was sitting there for about five minutes as the mashed potatoes were getting cold so the two chicken breasts for which there was an additional charge looked golden brown and delicious but when we cut into them they were dry. The food just was not good or fresh. The biscuits were cold and doughy, not light and fluffy. The noise level was very loud. I do not understand the popularity of this place. There were plenty of workers there, there was no reason my food took so long and still came out cold, overcooked and just not worth it.\n",
            "A few weeks ago I tried a cheesesteak sub which was bland, dry, and overcooked but not the worst sub I have had.  Tonight I ordered a Buddy Pizza which is buffalo chicken, blue cheese, and ranch.  It was horrible.  Covered in giant chunks of blue cheese like someone had poured thick dressing all over it, and the chicken was springy and off in taste like it was microwaved.  My last half of the pizza I removed all toppings entirely (see photo) and was left with soggy crust and sauce.  Big disappointment.  I miss the Raj Halot gourmet cheesesteak sub that was offered by Neapoli's at this location in the past.  I will not be hurrying back to Three Dogs after tonight's experience.\n",

The first person could not help me, her name was Jewels, she then transferred me to her supervisor Juanita.  Juanita was the rudest, nastiest person i have ever talked to.  She kept wanting to get off the call, and then proceeded to hang up on me.  I asked her not to hang up, and she did anyway.  So i called back.  I ended up getting a hold of her again (although the young lady before her, who answered my call, was almost as rude as Juanita), Juanita would not give me her supervisor/bosses name, she said \"i am the highest person in charge\", and i asked her why did she hang up on me?  Guess what?  She hung up on me again!  Please let me find out who her boss is, and what you all plan on doing about this HUGE problem in customer relations.\n",
            "We had a group of 3.  Tried 3 different dishes and we had a taste of each other's dishes.  None of us liked any of the food.  Very bland.  2 added meatballs were $6 also pretty bland.  Added chicken which was maybe 1/4th of a chicken breast for $6.  The gnocchi seemed overcooked with no flavour.  The ravioli seemed like it was sitting out for a while before it was served. Our glasses and cutlery were dirty.  Our glasses were kept filled with water but the service was mediocre.  Not once were we asked if everything was tasting okay.

            "On holiday in Florida - went to Millers Ale House for a meal, as recommended to us. We were told that the portions were huge.  They were average. When we came in the waiter was very helpful and friendly.  A remark was made by one of our party to observe the situation,  they are like actors and playing a part and can change once you have finished your meal and have paid your bill. Act I - Hi my name is ... I am your waiter for this evening.  What would you like to drink?  We ordered sprite - he looked at us as if we had three heads.  Maybe it was because we did not order alcoholic drinks.  We then ordered our meal. It came and we ate it and then\n",

It was just set down on the table without being asked if we wanted any dessert etc.   Act III one member of our party took out his cash card and the waiter said are you paying with that (no exaggeration - these were his exact words - it was if it was not good enough.  He actually then reached for the card to take it away to get payment for the meal.  The member of our party obviously was not going to let this happen and went to the till with him, but I must say a tip was given to the waiter at this point and then came the Finale - there was no 'Thank You Sir' .  He just took it and did not even say good bye thank you for coming.  Will not be back.  Will be going to Ruby Tuesdays instead. The star is for the àctors.\n",

            "I am totally shocked at the rave reviews this mediocre place has gotten. First off, let me say the service was probably the worst I have ever received in a restaurant. The waiter had a horribly snooty attitude from the moment we sat down. He was very condescending towards everyone in our group as he began to explain this place's endless rules for ordering. We were schooled on their \"order together, eat together, pay together\" nonsense policy which involved one order card for the entire table and a dragonfly card for questions?!? We had a big group, and he insisted that we could only fill out one card for the entire table. The waiter kept coming over and telling us that their policy was easy to understand and that we were just confused. He also proceeded to inform us that this method has worked for over 7 years at their primary restaurant in Connecticut and that he had over 15 years in the service industry?!? What? Who does that?!? The dishes came out (not served by our own waiter, of course) in waves leading to some folks finishing their meals before others had been served. The food was decent, but no different than any other tapas place in town, and both the food and drinks seemed to be overpriced ($48.99 for a \"carafe\" of magaritas?). We had to divvy up our own checks (which required a degree in calculus) and did far more work for ourselves than our waiter did. The best part about this place was the ambiance and decor. Otherwise, it is a definite miss. This place has potential if they pull their heads out of their own tails and realize that their ordering/payment policies are extremely customer unfriendly. I would discourage anyone from wasting their time or money. I would rather eat at Taco Bell. At least they are friendly and know how to divide.\n",

Second trip, even worse service! Same slow service, a friend waited 40 minutes for our server to come back and tell her they were out if the beer she ordered, then walked away promptly not giving her time to order another if she wanted. I ordered a cheeseburger, came with no cheese 30 minutes later. I got all my drinks from the bar because our server was so slow. When I cashed out I had 'added gratuity' to a $8 tab. I asked the managers grat policy and she said it was for $100 or more tabs! 3rd time, still same server, terrible service, but this time the bar told my party to not order from the bar and order from our server......who never came around.....consistently disappointing restaurant.

No. Let me know what you do when you get food poisoning and you are either hunching over the toilet or sitting on it every 15-20 minutes, knowing you will hear nothing from the doctor except \"let it run it is course\" and that is when you get to the the doctor, after stopping at a gas station(s) on the way there and then sit and wait in the waiting room and have to hit the bathroom in the waiting room and likely come back out and they tell you \"oh, we thought you left and we took the next person in line\" and then when you finally get in to see the doctor, you need to temporarily leave and then some back, only to hear those famous words?\n",

            "NEVER AGAIN. I live in Grandview and face Buckeye Hall of Fame each day while on the treadmill at Urban Active, so I finally gave it a try at around 3:30pm on a Sunday. When we walked in, the hostess asked us, with an attitude, if we made a reservation. I explained that I did not think that was necesary, as it was an in-between time, but she told us we had to sit at the bar. No big deal. I have waited tables before and I have patience with those in the food industry because I know how stressful it can be, but my experience here went beyond what any reasonable customer would tolerate. The bar was clearly short staffed, as it was completely full with 1 bartender serving the entire area. I am not exaggerating when I say it took 25 minutes before we were even acknolwedged, and that was only because I reached over the bar and grabbed menus, which is a surefire way to piss off a bartender. I recently went gluten-free, and it took another decent chunk of time for me to flag down the bartender to ask for a gluten free menu.  She first told me they did not have one, but then asked a waitress who brought me one. This is unacceptable these days, where food allergies are increasingly prevalent. I later overheard that the OSU baseball team was coming in later from some excited teenage waitresses, which explains why the attention was diverted away from the other diners in the restaurant. Long story short, I ended up getting \"naked tenders\"- chicken fingers without any breading- which were unbearably dry.  This place should go under with their rude staff and inability to accommodate those with food allergies; however their location (next to a hotel with tourists who do not know any better) and plethora of Buckeye memorabilia will keep them afloat.\n",

I truthfully have had better bbq buying from the grocery store and reheating it in my microwave.  At least that stuff was warm.  Sausage was the best of my three meat plate it that is not saying much.  It was greasy, cold, and way to much fat in it.  Rib was the worst of the three with much more fat then meat on the bone, and no rub on the outside.  All together very disappointed.\n",

Based on previously enjoyable meals we had at Milestones years ago we decided to try the Vancouver location, as it was fairly close to our next destination~ Park Theater. The ambience and Servers and Bellinis's were great but the food is awful! Actually I must backtrack a bit~ as soon as you walk into the Restaurant you can smell the 'greasy fried smell' like their ventilation system not working properly... Keith started with the French Onion soup- not hot enough and strangely tasting of a hickory chipotle flavor...our main courses came slowly despite our initial request for a prompt meal due to time restrictions.. 50 minutes later Keith was presented with his meal, the Louisiana Seafood dish, which was overly salted and overly sauced. Plenty of shrimp but tasteless and with a lackluster presentation. My meal was the Special 'Superfood' of Cod and Goji berries. Bleh. My cod was too salty, too dry and the rice was swimming  in unappetizing Goji berry sauce . The green beans however were good after  I dripped the sauce off. We had leftovers but certainly did not want to bring any of it home. Full points though to our Server Sheila (friendly)and the other fellow who brought our bill. He gave us an unasked for discount to make up for the backed up kitchen and delay on our meal.( Thank You). While no one did come to ask how our meal was while we were eating we do have to say all the Servers are very friendly and seem to work well together as a Team, perhaps unknowingly trying to makeup for The abysmal food.\n",

(AND I asked for no tomatoes!)  I mean come on, service like this I would much rather go to thundercloud, jersey mikes, or even SUBWAY!

The food was fine but absolutely not memorable.  There were some pretty glaring flaws, Black Sea bass that had been hammered on the grill and a greasy broken sauce on the aglonotti.  The food felt uninspired and paired with the servers looking at our table and trying to figure out who was taking care of us, the night was extremely disappointing.  I would be willing to give this restaurant another chance because there are off nights but I do not have the budget or the heart for another epic disappointment.\n",

I mean when our little ones do not want to eat the food, we know its bad... The place was just disgusting, the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky. Yuck. We will never come back to thus place. We spent about $60 and left hungry. NEVER AGAIN\n",

After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we were not ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else.

Tables were dirty and was not wiped down before seating us. The bathrooms was disgusting. Way over priced for such little to no service in returned!!

I do not know what the hell they did to my pizza, but I became violently ill within an hour of leaving the place.  I should have gone to the hospital and filed a complaint against this place with the department of health, but I did not.  Instead, I spent the weekend in bed/the bathroom of my dorm, the sickest I have ever been in my entire life.

            "Very unreliable.  I keep going through the drive-through to get a $1 coffee.  Maybe half the time they actually get the order right...the rest of the time leaving out the flavor, or putting sweetened rather than unsweetened flavor, etc.  It is not a hard order, and we have started asking for confirmation that they understand the 'UNsweetened' part because I really dislike sweet coffee.  This week we tried to go through the drive-thru in the rain...they kept starting to ask for the order on the intercom, then disappearing...which is more of a problem when it is raining and the rain is pouring in to the car while we wait for them to actually take the order.  So we drove around and I ran in to order.  After several minutes I am handed my coffee and I ask to confirm, 'UNsweetened', right?  And I am assured that yes, it is unsweetened.  Nope.  Plus there is syrup all over the cup so it sticks to my hands and gets on everything.  It is a convenient location and the coffee deal is good, but not worth it when it is wrong at least half the time.\n",

I am talking wet dough-undercooked, and not just in the center. In addition, the pie lacked flavor. I do not need an overwhelming amount of sugar and spice in my apple pie, but this one barely had anything other than apples.\n",

But there was no apology, no surprise/disappointment expressed, no offer of an exchange pie, no goodwill gesture of a slice on the house. I mean, it would be one thing if I had returned the pie because I did not like its flavor. But this pie was not even cooked through and it was pretty obvious.\n",

But everyone around us did \"clean\" their plates so I guess the food was good...I will never know though, we left and found a place that sells alcohol for our brunch date!\n",

Alleged Kung Pao chicken slimy, strange aftertaste, no real sauce, dry peanuts piled on top.

We were the only ones there.   Our group was mixed with some wanting coffee and others wanting a beer/wine.  I thought this place was perfect because they can take care of both.  But, the attitude of this woman was negative, almost angry!  Needless to say I will never set foot in the place again.  I am pretty sure she was the owner so do not expect any better....to bad, a good concept but lacking personality and warmth.\n",

I should have drove to Wendy's for some food with flavor! I had the meatballs and double order of macaroni and cheese. The macaroni noodles were over cooked and the meatballs were very bland. My cornbread was MEH. I also had got a chocolate cake, it tasted like Saran Wrap. I will be sure to drive pass this place for now on.\n",

            "House of Blues has a well known reputation of being called \"House of rules\". They strictly turn down anyone from entering the show for the slightest reason or they kick people out easily. Ok I understand that, although it can be slightly frustrating when some innocent people get turned down or kicked out. What I DO NOT understand is why it took an hour and a half (I am not exaggerating. I arrived at the venue at nine and finally entered at 10:25) to allow people into the venue. The line was enormous and went down the block. What made matters worse was that the line hardly moved at a reasonable pace. There were people freezing  (this was at 6 degrees) and it even started to snow. I, and everyone else who had to wait, know the doors open at seven, but we have the freedom to arrive whenever we want. If house of blues wants to avoid absurd lines, poor customer service, freezing customers, visibly unhappy people (ex. people boo-ing) then clearly state when doors will close therefore avoiding absurd waiting and clusters of people or have a better system of getting people into the venue. I paid money expecting to see a full two set venue of Lotus. I only got to see the last set, but was very unhappy with the cold, wait, and lack of organization and coat check. This has made me want to never support the House of Blues corporation ever again. A twenty minute wait is understandable, but an hour and a half?! I had enough time to walk a block and a half to the nearest restrooms and back. The line was still growing too during the wait. Additionally,  tickets were still being sold at 9:30 too. What is with the desperation of trying to over-pack people into a venue that is clearly demonstrating their lack of ability to accommodate? Extremely disappointed.  (Event was for Lotus 1/25)\n",

We declined and then he told us he would take the food off our bill but we still had to pay for the beer. Bad, bad, bad customer service. I know they have captive and transient customers, but this was very poor management.\n",

Then the dumpling was served, and it looks like an appetizer. It is supposed to be a Korean restaurant (and Korean owner), which usually serves with free appetizers. Plus all other guests around us got this dish. So I thought this is free appetizer, and I ate it. It is really not tasty at all, nor was the rest of the food we ordered. Then we got the bill and found this food was listed. I said I did not know it is not free, and I actually did not order it. She said \"But you eat it!\" What? You put this in our order without saying any word, and then make it like appetizer so that we got confused about it! Very bad and dishonest server. The food is just average, and it is too expensive. I do not see why people come to this restaurant. It is totally not worth it!\n",

The receptionist asked if I wanted to eat in or take-out and after I stated I wanted take-out and a moment to peruse the menu, I was bombarded with a million questions.  I kindly asked her to give a moment while I familiarize myself with their menu and to catch my breath.  Whether it was from the long, hot day/walk or petulant lady, the menu was becoming blurring so I just asked if they had a seafood noodle dish rather than reading the menu.

The server was talking it up big time, and told us how it frees up so much of his time to keep up on refills and chat with customers. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite happened.

When the device summoned him over, he did not offer to get us refills, did not remember that he forgot our ranch, and did not offer to bring me a to-go box even though I had eaten less than half of my food. He just fixed the glitch and ran off. To give you some perspective, we were there right when they opened at 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday, and there were only 5 total tables sat in the restaurant. Being too busy certainly was not the excuse here.\n",

I left feeling like throwing up the first time. So round two !!! The service is standard no complaints there but the food is below average and not worth the price. I ordered a bubba roll and salmon sashimi. The roll consists of shrimp tempura avocado and cream cheese. My tempura shrimp was 80% tempura and it was not even hot. it was cold and slightly stale. The star of the roll should have been the shrimp but all I got was a mouth full of rice and stale tempura.. The fish was okay but for some reason I was extremely nauseated after my meal for the second time here ..That normally does not happen to me after sushi except when I eat here. I will never spend money here again.\n",

They put butter in the same box with the food so of course the heat melted it. The wings were absolute garbage! Who serves chicken and waffles with non-breaded UNSEASONED wings!? Yep, they just dropped the wings in the grease and through them in the box. The waffle was cold and soggy by the time it arrived but I kind of expected to have to reheat it. I will never order from this joint again! Never.\n",

            "My Korean friend and I seated ourselves in the mostly empty restaurant on this rainy Saturday at noon. The waitress came out with menus and never took notice our table was filthy. I was raised in San Diego and am well famliar with Mexican food. Knowing the measure of true Mexican cookery, I ordered tacos al carbon with rice and beans, and a chicken tamale. The tamale came first and was a disaster wrapped in a banana leaf instead of a corn husk. It was filled with what appeared to be chicken pot pie filling. It was mushy, with potatoes and green beens in the mix. The masa was weak, thin, and soggy. My friend ordered a quesadilla with beef, as well as a burrito. The quesadilla was greasy,  but okay. The chicken and bean burrito had an abundance of sour cream and cheese and was also just okay. Ten minutes after we came in, a very noisy Mexican family came in and were served their food 15 minutes BEFORE we received the rest of ours. We spent a lot of time waiting despite being only one of three tables occupied. My tacos al carbon were pretty good. The guacamole was fresh as was the pico de gallo. The meat was lightly seasoned and not too fatty or overcooked. Altogether, I give this restaurant really bad marks for cleanliness, service, and effort. It was humiliating to be so obviously ignored over the other group who came in after we had already been waiting. Again, I worry about the cleanliness. They allowed young boys to crawl all over the tables and the booths, leaving messy handprints of food wherever they went. Our table was already covered in somone elses slopped refried beans and whatever else the sticky mess was. There is no excuse for that when the restaurant was nearly empty. It is just plain laziness. I will not eat there again. I noticed the Cantina a few doors down as we left and wished we had gone there instead. We only tried El Potro because we had a coupon. It was not worth the 10% discount. I may be sick.\n",

Upon sitting down we looked at the menu but we already knew what we were going to have. If you have been to Luke's you know that they have an open concept restaurant. Our server came over and took our order but upon looking around we saw that all the servers including our server, were seated at a long table on the floor eating what I suppose is their lunch. I use to work as a server and it has never been acceptable to eat in front of guest especially if they do not have their food yet. There were about 8 servers seated just eating. We got our food pretty quickly and were very excited to start eating since we love this dish so much. Unfortunately it did not taste as it normally has in the past which is AMAZING! We still ate everything but when our server came around and asked how was everything my husband asked if they had possibly changed the chicken recipe? Because it just did not taste as it did all the other times we came. She explained that the recipe was still the same so we said ok no big deal. I saw her approach the manager on the floor to tell him about our question on the chicken recipe. He looked at me while she was talking because our server pointed to our table and he rolled his eyes like he did not want to be bothered about the situation. Plus we were the only guest at the restaurant at that time. He not once came to our table. Me and my husband were not looking for a free meal or anything free for that matter because we ate the dish.

            "On May 19, 2018, at approximately 3:30 pm, my husband and I came across the Bluehour outdoor seating area.  We were looking forward to a snack and a drink.  Since we have a small, well behaved dog on leash, we sat down at one of the 7 or 8 tables, the last one in the row.  There seemed to be only one waiter, who was middle aged and white.  He seemed very pre-occupied with all the tables at the other end of the row.  He never once acknowledged us, greeted us, or or made eye contact with us.  He also helped another couple who sat down five minutes after us at the other end.  After ten minutes of no service, we flagged down the busboy, and asked for menus, which he promptly brought us, along with water.  The waiter was running back into the restaurant yet again fetching something for other customers, when we called to him \"are you our waiter?\"  He nodded yes and ran into the restaurant. We finally had enough and left after 15 minutes of waiting.  All the other tables were filled with white customers and we are Asian American.  I can only conclude that this waiter is a racist and that is why he blatantly ignored us.   I thought Portland was a progressive and welcoming city.  One racist waiter does not represent Portland, but he is representing Bluehour. \n",

I had to give it a one star to post this.\n",

No one said a word to us, so we preceded to finding a booth. We sat down .... 15 mins later nothing. Waited an additional 7-8 mins. NOTHING. I got up to use the restroom which was DISGUSTING. Came back, and still nothing. We finally left and went down the st to the Hub Pub who is Yelp page I am off (once again), to leave a GREAT review because THEY were fantastic. The doorman at the Hub Pub was named Dave and he made us feel right at home. This SideBar place was GARBAGE.\n",

The cornbread taste like a sugar loaf and was disgusting. Some of the staff where also playing around in the back. Which was further making the line and service longer.

Fifteen minutes later we were led to a large round table in the entryway of the restaurant at the bottom of the stairs. Many tables were empty so this did not make since. Bread & water came right away and they took our drink order promptly - the drinks, however did not COME promptly. Four of the worst Mojitos I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. Bitter, undrinkable! Shared our concerns with the waiter who offered to do nothing. Eventually we got up to find the waiter to place our order. After we placed our orders, we requested new drinks. The waiter finally returned with our drinks & explained that the bartender had used water instead of simple syrup to make the drinks. Really!!?! Food was a passing grade but service was a D, drinks an F, seating gets a D. None of our drinks were comped and he only replaced 3 out of 4 of the Mojitos. Overpricing attempted to give the restaurant an air of luxury - D minus. However, the beer was excellent!\n",

After I succeeded and we sat down outside with our 9week old puppy we ended up getting ignored by several different servers that looked directly at us. Extremely disappointing and with more restaurants opening in the Lake Nona area, they should really reconsider their customer service policy. You lost one.\n",

Got a skinny margarita with grand marnier which was bright orange, had no lime in it whatsoever, was way too sweet and I do not believe had grand marnier in it because that stuff are not bright orange nor icky sweet, nor is agave or lime. Fine, we are trying to have a good time, did not complain. There was a table there with 6 people yelling loudly while several kids ran around and yelled the entire time we were there. Fine we are trying to just have some fun, any kind of fun, a little relaxation for once but nooooooo. Got the bill. My drink was a 12 ounce drink for which they up charged me so it was 7.25 for the grand marnier and 7.99 for the skinny margarita, none of which I ever got. That is when I lost it. Plus there was a piece of bone in my chicken breast which was tough, their response \"it happens\" and their ranchero salsa???? was not as the waiter described nowhere to be found, they said it is under the cheese. paid 32 bucks for a piece of hard chicken breast, rice like dixie 65 cent saffron rice, beans and a terrible drink. The manager came out and said the gm says sorry but they explained the upcharge for the drink beforehand. Oh hell no they did not. Mr. Rogers( he sounded like Mr. Rogers to me)  just said they could not put a shot in.  Needless to say we wasted our one bit of respite and hard earned money and if they had any sense they would have comped the drink and taken half off the meal for the piece of chopped bone in my  \"boneless\"  chicken. Also the menu price was not what I was charged anyway it was two dollars more. Whatever, the salsa and chips were outstanding.\n",
            "If there was a 0 star review, that is what they would be getting. I went through the drive-thru and ordered. When I got to the window and paid, I sat there for 5 minutes. They opened the window and asked me to move forward and they would bring my food out shortly and I did so. Sat there for another 15-20 minutes before I decided to walk in so I was not late getting back to work. They told me it still was not ready. I asked for my money back and had to wait a few minutes for somebody to do that too. They handed me cash and I walked out to realize that it was not as much as I had paid for NO FOOD. I did not go back in. That was not worth my time. No customer service values whatsoever. They should all be fired. Learn from my mistake. Do not go here ever.\n",
            "the pizza here is horrible. just horrible. my fiance picked me up two slices for lunch, and when i opened the brown bag, the smell was so bad. it did not even smell like pizza. i think there was something up with the cheese...i think it was a really cheap, bad quality mozzarella, and the slice was overloaded with it. i tried to put it in the oven to crisp it up and that did not work either...it was slimy and covered with canned mushrooms. gross!\n",

The people who speak with you in the drive thru intercom are EXTREMELY rude and give you attitude. Oh yeah, and I was 3rd in line at the drive thru and waited more than 10 minutes to reach the intercom.

Although there appeared to be lots of space elsewhere. The waiter brought us some chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips were tasty, but the guacamole had way to much lime in it and could have used some cumin and smoked paprika for more flavor. This part of the review is from my 9 yo---\n",
            "The kids meal had only a few choices, which did not include burritos! You would think that burritos would be one of the first items that you saw on the kids menu at a Mexican restaurant, especially since kids like burritos. I suggested to the waiter that burritos be added to the menu. When I finally got my food I looked inside my chicken taco, and saw that the chicken was FRIED. Also, l had asked for lettuce ,tomato, and cheese. They only gave me lettuce, no tomato or cheese! Also, the lettuce they gave me was only a measly amount. The fries that came with the tacos were just okay. Overall, the experience was not worth it and we would not go back! Let this be a warning to you before you consider going! From my perspective, I thought the food was also underwhelming. I had the verde enchiladas, which were pretty bland and lacking in flavor. The best thing I had was the Raspberry Margarita.\n",

            "The tea and soup was okay. The tuna gomae came with the thick flavourless sauce squeezed out into a squiggle across the top of the tuna. We awkwardly scraped it off and struggled to mix the sauce into the spinach. The flavour was sub par and the work to mix the sauce in was ridiculous. \n",
            "\n",
            "The smoked salmon salad seemed okay, but really just sliced smoked fish on iceberg lettuce. And then I tasted the tomato slice and promptly spat it out. It was clearly a bit rotten. \n",
            "\n",
            "The spicy salmon sashimi was straight up inedible. Unlike almost every sushi place I have been to, the sauce is heavy with mayo and only a little spicy in the finish. The overall flavour impression was close to garbage. We each ate one piece and set it aside and sent it back. They took it off our bill with little protest. They did however try to justify the flavour by telling us how the sauce was made. I did not really care what was in it, because it was terrible. Get you shit together Volcano Sushi. \n",

After we finished eating tonight, their debit card machine broke and we did not have enough cash on us. The owner's brother then came out to \"talk\" to us by treating us like thieves and giving us dirty looks. He would not let us leave to get cash together or drive us to the nearest ATM machine and insisted that we gave him an ID or something valuable. In addition, he kept talking about us in a very impolite way because he mistakenly thought I could not understand Cantonese. He also waited and chatted with a bunch of guys outside the restaurant as if he feared that we would run away or something. In the end, I let them know that I have already called the police and the officer was on his way. Miraculously, they then fixed the machine and we left. The owner offered us a $1 worth of coupon in the end for an hour of wasted time (seriously). Due to my awful experience of being treated like criminals, I would like to encourage everyone to question their decision to ever go there again.\n",
            "So my darling girlfriend and i decided to order a buffet's worth of food because her two teenage brothers were spending the weekend with us. Before beginning to fight off the void that was in my stomach we had to decided on what to take out.  After pulling up the menu off their website we decided upon ordering General Tso's, orange chicken, chicken fried rice, and wonton soup. according to the prices listed, it was supposed to come out to thirty-one and some change. We agreed upon our feast for the night and called in our takeout order. They Informed us that the order would be ready for us in 15 minutes. Upon our arrival we were prompted to have a seat and our order would be ready for us in a few more minutes. About 15 minutes  passed before our food finally arrived and we were asked to grant them their monetary compensation. At this time we took note that there was some foolery afoot. the bill was 39 dollars! No sense in causing a scene over a measly $8 when we had come this far we happily paid our bill and drove home to devour our purchase. Upon arrival at our domicile we were ready to slay the wretched beast of starvation! Opening the boxes which we expected to contain a sweet and succulent dinner, we were met with a familiar odor, it was not one of chicken, but of fish. We refused to let the smell throw us off our course! We dug in with plans to demolish the boxes of mystery meat and rid our bellies of our foe hunger. Upon dishing up our feast, we noticed the flavor was far less than satisfactory. it smelled of the sea, it tasted of faint lemon mixed with crustaceans and had the slimy texture of a clam. But we ordered another dish of chicken! This was to be General Tso,  a firey temperament and unforgiving explosion of flavor were in order!  We divied up the contents of this box, hoping that the contents would be at the very least edible! We were once again met by the fishy odor and slimy texture, identical to that of the orange chicken. Thus we were defeated! As hard as we tried we were unable to stomach this beast! Far to wretched a creation for us mere mortals to consume! Even our feline companions refused the putrid contents of our Chinese food cartons. The battle was lost, we were unable to finish what we had started. All we could do was banish it from our realm and pray to the god Hefty that his odor seal was as strong as the legends fore told. \n",

I waited patiently for someone to acknowledge me and nothing, nada. I knew what I wanted when I walked in yet sat there and watched 2 tables who came after me get waited on. When the waitress approached a third table that was seated - no joke - 30 seconds prior, I caught her eye and asked if anyone was waiting on my section as I had been there awhile and was ready to order. She claimed she did not see me and made no attempt to apologize or offer me a drink. Needless to say, I left and went somewhere else where I was immediately waited on and am now happily drinking and eating. For the record, former waitress here so I am normally very understanding and patient and willing to give a place a second shot but not a third one.\n",

So I am penalized because o do not eat pork sausage?  If I had know it was extra I might still have ordered it and then would not have been surprised by the extra charge.  That is just fraud.\n",

It is next to a few other eateries who share the common patio at Brookhaven Station with Mellow Mushroom and Pub71.. Hudson Grill has a decent array and set-up of TV's for sporting events and they have NFL ticket. They also have a relatively adequate bar in both the main and outdoor dining areas serving about 50 beers on tap. The dining room is not terribly unpleasing and it is comfortable. Everything after that goes downhill. The noise levels can peak to areas where discussions in normal volume is not possible. The parking accommodations are tight and there is overflow parking at the bank across the street, where you are burdened of risking your life of crossing the street. They are owned by the same folks who bring us Cheyenne Grill, Joe's and Cowtippers. Unfortunately with that level of financial backing, they are not interested in offering quality food or retaining the customer\n",

            "I have visited Hudson many times to catch NFL games or play trivia. I have always been reluctant to order food because of previous unpleasant experiences. The latest experiences further solidified this restaurant either lacks competence in the kitchen or do not give a s h i t  - or both. We 1st ordered the buffalo chicken wings covered wet. When they arrived, I had a few and noticed they were undercooked. There was noticeable fat between the skin and meat. Plus the meat around the joints did not seem to be fully cooked. I sent those back and did not make a big deal of it. There is no reason to give the server a hard time if food is not adequately cooked.\n",

Once it got to my table, the fries seemed; hell I do not know, but they were definitely not fresh. It seemed they were over-cooked, left out in the kitchen somewhere to become stale...I was not sure what was wrong with them. They had some weird coloration as well. I tried two and that was enough. The burger was medium rare to raw and I ordered medium. The middle was cold too. The bun was not fresh either and had a firm consistency. I have had fresher buns from the bakery. I asked the server to return that dish and just settled for beers. She was nice enough to remove the items from the bill and I left a decent tip for her trouble.\n",

The service was so bad, I could not believe it. IT took forever to get our food and they got many items wrong. Some people were served and others not (at the same table of 10 pp) Let me say, that I was getting my entree when everyone else was eating the Birthday cake. It was ridiculous. There were other dishes left on the table without being cleared away.   When I turned to talk to a person on my right side, I turned back around to continue to eat my Entree and my plate was taken away by the Waiter with the food that I was still eating!! They took it away without asking me. So, they prepared another dish for me to take home.\n",

We ordered a scallop roll and when it came out, it did not look similar to the other times we had ordered it previously. They assured me it was not shellfish, knowing she was allergic as I had previously disclosed this to the waiter. Half way through eating it, I found a big piece of shrimp. We then had to go to the hospital. They insisted it was scallop when it clearly was not after the shrimp was found. In fact, the roll they brought out to us was nowhere to be found on the menu (some of the ingredients were not listed anywhere on the menu). Since they seem to run out of ingredients a lot, they made up a roll to serve people after running out of a product. It is too dangerous to fool people and promise an ingredient is something that it is not. The lack of professionalism and honesty is why I will never return, which is unfortunate because the food is really good. But if they cannot keep up with supply chain and lie about what they serve you, it is too dangerous to try if you have severe food allergies.\n",

The corn was incredibly old and overcooked, basically tasted like soggy corn. The mashed potatoes tasted old and bland. The clam chowder was watery and had a kind of \"rotten\" flavor to it, as if the clams they used were of the poorest quality they could find. As for the lobster.... The entire body of the lobster (everything except for the majority of the tail and claws) was completely green, mushy, diarrhea, no sign of meat whatsoever-- basically they gave us the lobster that was already almost dead. It was also overcooked to the point that I could not even chew it. That, in my book, is NOT fresh seafood, and I wonder what else they had served that was practically dead and sickly. \n",

He made fun of my friend's drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling. When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I have ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager. Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again. The food was even mediocre.\n",

No sign of anyone besides the teenage receptionists busy chatting with each other, our waitress had totally disappeared, and by that time I just wanted out of this place.

I asked for Taziki or Tahini sauce since the kabob was so flavorless. He said he needed to put an order in for that and it would be more money. Then we all had a service charge, but no explanation prior to receiving that charge. Not impressed. The vibe felt middle eastern, but the prices were too high for what you get.\n",

On top of that, it came with  mayonnaise, just like I was in Canada.  When I told the waitress that they should either list mayonnaise as standard on the menu or not add it, I was told I was mistaken and it was listed on the menu.  I then grabbed a menu and, lo and behold, it is not mentioned as being standard on a burger.  So, instead of the customer is always right (even when he or she is not), here the customer was wrong, even when he was right.  On top of that, they never asked me for a drink order, though I tried twice.  It is also pricey, which makes it expense account only, though I would never take a client there again.\n",

Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. \n",

I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I could not quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. \n",

I will check on it, though.\" He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, I would be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.\n",

Otherwise, it is like any other college dive bar, but with imprudent, and pathetic ownership, and management. It seems as if all the people they hire to work the door are the type of people that were never liked in any other facet of their life, so they use their power as \"door men\" to feel good about themselves. The manager is no better, in fact, he is probably the worst one of all of them. It does not matter if good, upstanding customers have been waiting in line for over an hour, he will allow any BU athlete, or male he deems \"cool\" to skip the line and go in. I guess,  it is the only way he feels good about himself, but it is no way to run a business. Furthermore, I have seen on more than one occasion, girls being harassed by the door men. The only girls that are ever let in without a problem, are those girls who flirt shamelessly with them. The length of the line and the doormen's tactics in dealing with it might not be a problem if they did not let only two people in per 30 minutes (no matter how crowded to bar is) and let college kids of all ages in to party....yes, they check ID's for show, but it seems as if there is no \"real\"  age discrimination when deciding to let a person in.\n",

It is a shame because once you are inside, the bar staff, music, and food are pretty good!

Chopped romaine lettuce with a few veggies - what a terrible waste of $9.50. But the real reason for the bad star was the service.  We waited nearly 2 hours for our food, with no apology from a manager (no manager was sighted at all) nor a comp I will not be coming back to this location anytime soon. Sad since Gordough's is supposed to be this amazing place, I really wanted to like it.\n",

Waitress was honest enough to tell us that this was the third complaint in two days about the portion and composition of the salad.  Very disappointed.\n",

I have been here more than a dozen times because I work next door and take people out to lunch for work and they usually choose here because they have either never been and want to try it or they think its convenient for me because I work next door, and them because parking is easy.  SO, first there is this waitress that I somehow always get and I do not think she even knows how to smile.  She takes orders in a rush and walks away when you are not even finished ordering.  She drops the check well before you are finished and basically just looks miserable constantly.  I do not know her name but she is tan, has long black straight hair, sunglasses on her head normally and sort of on the heavy side.  Fail for service right there.  Second, the food.  EVERYTHING is fried!!!  With the exception of a few things that are so bland I might as well just not eat.  The fried food is not even good fried.  Its like fish, batter, then fried.  I do not want mushy batter with my fish.  And the calamari has fried yellow peppers within it, too... which I love... but it is like they try and trick you because they look the same as the calamari so they give you practically all peppers and no calamari.  Not cool.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for 9 years and this place has some serious kinks to work out.  I am surprised, too, because they are famous!  You would think they would have a better management team to spruce the place up.  And for the record (if barking crab is reading this) most people in the city of Boston that I have spoken to says they come for the atmosphere and that the food is awful.  I would like to come here and eat more so please make some changes!!!  Now I just come for the beer...\n",

Came back to ask what is this about, and then I found out someone gave me valet parking on my account to pay (when was this confirmed with me???) on top of those two holds. I asked that this has to be put on paper for me all the charges that is happening because how am I supposed to pay by cash if I have almost half the stay not accessible on my card because of holds? Then Jennifer came by and told me that my card was declined on check in, so someone was doing me a favor by letting me stay and just put holds. Does that make sense to decline a card and charge anyway? Sounded like a derail of my argument.

            "I am just in awe. I never really write reviews but this was so bad it warrants one. I got up and walked out it was that bad. I ordered the front porch with cheese. Basic burger. Lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard and cheese. Was really looking forward to \"skinny fries\" as few places have them around here. First off it took longer than expected to even have food delivered. When my burger arrived...I think there was a burger under all the mustard..but there surely was not any lettuce or tomato. The burger tasted frozen, once you got past the mustard. The fries? I am pretty sure they were frozen as well. Overdone and should have been called chips.  I asked the server if I had the correct burger, I had to basically yell at him as it was so loud in the place (there were maybe 10 people, it was more music and TV noise). He did not particularly seem to care, and just brought me a slice of tomato and lettuce like I inconvenienced him.  Overall it was just a horrible experience.  I had wanted it to be awesome as I have not found any real burger places here yet, but this place? This will not be happening again.\n",

They still forgot to give us the coke so we get their attn and finally got the coke. This place is falling apart fast. I give them months before McDonald's takes all the customers. STAY AWAY from this hole in the wall!\n",

Today went to lunch and was so dissatisfied-ordered clams and mussels that floated in mystery vegetable broth, calamari fried to the point the calamari inside the breading were shrunken like shrunken heads with a side of tomato paste that pretended to be a marinara sauce \" fresh\" grouper also fried came with a slice of craft single on it, total culinary disaster.

It is not a big deal.\" WELL, I have never written a yelp review until this place. Not only haven I physically gone to this place a few times, but I have lazy-lunch ordered with friends through Uber eats from here. Intercom apparently broken in drive-thru. (sat there for about 5 minutes before I reversed and went to the other one, so that review was true) Immediately I noticed the fries had the oddest rotten taste, and chicken CLEARLY was not cooked through (and that is saying something for McDonald's). The icing on this cake was when I ordered through uber eats. I ordered three meals with friends, multiple drinks, desserts, and even breakfast for the next morning (to make the uber delivery fee \"worth while\") When the delivery arrived, the driver said, sorry, this is all they had... and handed be a 10 piece of chicken nuggets.

First of all there were no signages for that and when I asked the cashier what kind of hot chocolate they have she said we only have one kind. Having looked at the online menu beforehand, I asked her about the HC festival thing then she handed me the \"menu\" for it. The cashier and another staff could not figure out how to put it into their system and took us a long time and the whole time they did not apologize at all for the wait. We ordered two hot chocolates (Machamour and Fiore di latte) and they were served to us in to-go plastic cups with straws. First of all we did not ask for it to go, and second of all, both \"hot chocolates\" were cold. It is nowhere indicated on their menu that these two beverages are cold. The mini waffles that they serve with the drink are rock hard and cold. This is by far THE WORST hot chocolate we have ever experienced. Customer service is way down too. Do not bother coming to this place. Have not tried their pizzas or gelato, but the staff seem to not know what they are doing at all. We paid $20 in total for our two hot chocolates and the taste is so bad. Save yourself a trip and go to Tim Horton's instead if you just decent hot chocolate for 1/5th of the price.\n",

I am actually impressed neither of us got food poisoning, especially after reading some of the reviews on Google.\n",

After 15 minutes of waiting I was told that they ran out of \"steelhead benny\". I got regular benedicts instead. 15 minutes later we finally got our order BUT the ceasar salad was super cold. As a regular White Spot customer I was very disappointed.\n",

Pathetically small portions that are insulting.  the very small portion of  steamers were dumped in a bowl, with 50% of the portion broken or closed.  My husband got the Monk Fish and for $25.00 it came with a  thin,  pathetic piece of the fish, along with a few sliced up potatoes, (no vegetable, salad or even bread).  This place is surely not fine dining and we are in New England were seafood is plentiful, so where do they come up with their riduculously high prices and then have the audacity to serve such small quantities?  On top of this, the service was average at best.   Place is a ripoff....\n",
            "Went here for happy hour with coworkers. Food was ok but the portions were small for the price. It took a very long time to pay because they made us figure out how to split the check and tell them what to do. This just comes off as lazy to me.\n",
            "Absolutely disgusting food!  I ordered the tilapia and 2 tacos (beef and chicken) while my wife ordered two beef empanadas.  The dishes came with some very bland beans and rice; however, the worst part was the tilapia. It was far too undercooked; 1/2 of it was almost raw.  The chicken taco had gristle and bone in it.   The empanadas were very small and flavourless.  \n",

            "In the end we threw away most of the food.  I will never order from them again.  I just hope I did not get parasites from the fish.\n",

Since the menu did not specify how the fish was fixed I asked for it to be anything but fried. They delivered without napkins and basic utensils, the delivery guy was lost and THE FISH FRIED. I asked for a refund since my health does not allow me to eat it. They were super rude and hang up on the Grubhub's representative. I am thankful that the Grubhub team refunded me partially. Thanks for ruining you customer's night! Be honest the next time and return the money when you do something wrong.\n",

I got a burrito in a bowl - whatever those are officially called - and left off the dairy and beans (allergic.) After adding a bit of guacamole (it was literally only spoonful) I ended up with a scoop of rice, a scoop of chicken and a spoonful of Salsa with a bit of lettuce. The cost? $9.

I ordered $60 worth of food, it was to feed 4 adults and 2 small children. We all agreed the food was meh... but no one felt like going to the stone mountain area to get familiar food. Did not notice their food score was like a 80 B the time I went until after I paid for the food. If I would have saw that before hand I would walked out. It is sad wendys and steak n shake score higher on the food score that this place. The food is pricey and it does not reflect in the taste (ingredients) or the portion size. I asked for some more rice and the girl was like that is $2. I said how about I just leave all this shit here and go to a real restaurant? She begrudgingly gave more rice lol Happy we did not get sick though, I might try them out again if their food score improves. THAT IS A HUGE MIGHT, like if someone else was paying. Like I said it was not the worst but it is not the best. How do you run out of patties and coco bread and have no scotch bonnet sauce? I could see if it was 30 mins before close even an hour before close on the weekend but this was an early week day around 6pm. This place could be better with organization, better attitudes, and a higher food score.\n",

Also, the Sandwich came with a side of potato chips, and for some reason the chips did not taste right, almost rancid like, so I told the waitress and she brought me a different side of my choosing. Again, with the bill they charged for an extra side. How ridiculous is that. The waitress was not going to\n",

            "I wish I could give this place half a star , keep in mind I used to waitress and bartend for over two years . The ambience is absolutely beautiful not going to lie . But let us talk about the extremely RUDE waitress . No offers for a drink , never gave us a menu (mind you we were joining my cousins who sat down at 8:00 we arrived shortly after around 8:30) . My cousins had ordered two bottles of saki and agreed to split it among themselves and not my friends and I . When we got our orders of sushi one had a hair in it , but the waitress was not available to even take it back . Then the second order of sushi came out with shredded cheese on it which was not on the  description menu that I had to grab by myself due to our waitress not providing menus . So when we asked to have it removed the waitress did not apologize crossed her arms and just huffed in an angry disappointment . Luckily the manager was right next to her and agreed to have it removed . But it keeps getting better so when our tab arrived what do I see on our check .. A  portion charge for the two bottles on EVERYONE IS tab and not on the people who had agreed to pay for it .. So when asked to have this removed they told me they could not remove it . Okay fine whatever , but then I gave them $40 In cash and told the waitress to put the rest on my credit card. The waitress comes back and says \" so what happened was....\" No apology was given for mischarging my card just informing me that I will see it on my bank statement . UM SAY WHAT?! Get your shit together, if this waitress is not capable of handling big tables place her in a smaller section . Then when I was waiting for my partner the waitress kept bothering me for my payment . Just a horrible experience Atlanta is such a vibrant city I am sure I will find a way better place next time .\n",

Came back, checked to make sure our name was on the list and we had not been called (it had not been called and we were still on the list) and then waited outside. After about 40 min, we went to see how much longer it would be and they had crossed our name off. Claiming to had called us - ask anyone around, no one outside had been called. Fine, mistakes happen...however, the blonde haired woman at the front was rude about the whole thing. Instead of trying to figure out something, she looks at our (now empty) coffees and in a VERY snotty voice says \"or maybe you were getting coffee when we called your name.\" Needless to say we decided to call that hour a waste of our only morning in Portland and go elsewhere. Maybe their food is good. However, when your front staff is rude, snotty and unapologetic for a mistake that they made, your customers are better off going elsewhere.\n",

We were patient, polite, knew what we wanted to order, had our money ready.. every order was met with a scoff and/or an eyeroll. It felt like we were at Dick's Last Resort, but it was not a gimmick. Every interaction included some snarky, passive-aggressive remark or insult. We were appalled and furious. We ordered one drink, then left. I could understand being short with us or slightly rude if they were busy, but there were maybe 30 people in the bar and two bartenders working. It seems that if you are not a regular, you are not welcome. We will never be back.\n",

If I wanted a burrito bowl I would have been less of a fatty and ordered one!!), and took a bite into its ice cold center. Literally ice cold. IT IS SO BAD, YOU GUYS!! I cannot even believe it. If I had not been standing there while they made it I would have sworn they had taken a pre-made shittily wrapped burrito out of the fridge and tossed it into a bag. It is cold outside, but that sucker should have been steaming hot after the less than 5 minute drive back to my apartment. Definitely the most disappointing, terrible, glacier-cold burrito I have ever had. If you are reading this and have a smart brain and a hungry stomach: avoid waiting in line for an icy cold burrito and go down the street to Carl's. Clearly I had a dumb-dumb moment by choosing Chipotle. Do not be a dumb-dumb!\n",

When he got home, the fries were not in the bag.  Come on guys, three sandwiches and one fry is too tough to get right?  The beef was terrible!  Usually the roast beef is moist and tender but this time it was rubbery...I mean REALLY rubbery.  We have several choices in Powell so this restaurant will need to step it up if they want to make it.\n",

I ordered the chicken teriyaki during my first visit and bland is too nice of a word to describe it. The chicken was obviously from the freezer and it had the texture of an old rug. Second visit, I ordered the spicy seafood udon. For about $13 for a bowl of noodles, one would have at least some expectations. Well, well, well, flashbacks to first visit...bland and RAW scallops. NICE. The sushi boat we ordered was visually pleasing but I got to admit that, while making our order, the sushi chef started using his phone. Maybe he was looking up some recipes that had flavor. Next time I want bland food, I will have my dog make it....\n",
            "Service was better than the food. Dinner was unacceptably rushed, and arrived cold. Of the five of us, not one dish was warm. Everyone had food from streak, fish, soup...not one dish was warm. Taste of dinner entrees were overall mediocre at best. Place is not worth a second visit. And the atmosphere is extremely loud!!! And I am young, so to complain about a place being too loud is bad. Decor was cool, that is about it. Save yourself the time and money and hit up a real steakhouse elsewhere.\n",
            "I would never ever attend any event on the Odyssey after this weekend. The staff was incredibly nasty and rude, I was cursed off by what seemed to be the head security guard. Every member of my group was patted down getting on the boat, which is fine, but I am rather ticklish and when I giggled at one point during the extensive pat down, the security guard asked me, \"What the f*** is so funny?!\" before patting me down again. The food was terrible on the boat, nothing with any flavor, seemed like frozen food just microwaved. Yes the views are great, but I was not allowed on the deck of the boat for some reason. My girlfriend had a migraine about halfway through the cruise (likely due to the insanely loud and horrific DJ) and the crew would not let her go anywhere that was more quiet to try to ease her pain. Instead they told her too bad, and she spent the rest of the evening basically in tears until we docked. \n",

            "There were a total of 4 visible working here today. We waited for 1.5 hours before food came, then another 30 minutes for a side of Ranch and A1. This was after being seated immediately. The one manager was running around doing everything and was super apologetic and very kind, so please excuse her from this review. Our waiter/bartender did not speak - literally. He did not speak to us, come to our table ever again once our order was taken. It was instead the manager running food, getting sides, getting our check, ringing us up, etc. It was hard to pay for this experience.\n",

We did not even get addressed for the first 15 minutes until a manager bothered to stop chatting with the other manager (who was also on her cellphone) to establish that we had not been helped by yelling across another table...getting up would have been too much to ask.

I had what kind of soups they have he was telling me so I said okay cool I will get the chicken breast as he said that was an option! Well I waited 45 min for my food to get it spend $15 dollars on it and it is not even a soup it is a full chicken breast meal which I cannot eat because I have strep! So I called back to tell him he gave me the wrong food and he goes well I could not understand you and hole on he leaves me on hold for 7 min!! I had to hang up and call back just to get another attitude by the man! Like I already paid you gave me the wrong order that is not my problem I asked 3 times for soup and mentioned it a couple times asking what type of broth they have!!!

When they made a mistake on our order, the same server snatched our order sheet and took the order away. That really ruined our whole experience at the restaurant. I personally did not want to give tip but they bought the bill with the tip already included. Overall, I really had an unpleasant experience at this place.

We got there a few minutes early, and were taken to our table - probably the worst table in the restaurant. We had no view of the \"open kitchen\" and certainly no view of the waterfront - which was the only reason we picked this restaurant to begin with. We asked the hostess for a better table (as most of the restaurant was indeed empty) and were told that the rest of the tables were reserved by other guests. We explained that we thought that was the point of getting a reservation so that we could be one of those other lucky group of guests, but were again turned down. \n",

Sure they were nice but if you royally screw up and never have an answer there is a real problem with this business.  I stayed there with my family for a week as owner/guest because I was taking their tour to buy.  The place just pretends to be something it is not.  It is not a great high end resort AT ALL.  There is no maid service because you \"own\" the place so you clean it up. Okay fine. Well is there a vacuum cleaner...NO. Is there a broom and dust pan...NO. Is there a Mop and bucket...NO.  Only certain \"villas\" get a vacuum.  Well how about that great room?  Well really it is just a regular hotel room only set up with more walls and laid out differently. Okay but it comes with a washer dryer... yeah right... it is a washer dryer combo that will not dry no matter how long you leave it in there.  At least there were dryers in the other building.  I have to admit the pools were okay even though the better pool was at the other end of the resort.  The rest were shallow kid pools.  The best part of my trip came at the pools though.  When we were in there at night with other families having a nice time with my kids and wanted to leave.  All the exits were locked! Yes my family and I were locked in the pool area.  I tried all the doors and gates all LOCKED!!! No security comes around to check on guest someone could have been raped and killed in there and no one would know.  I observed after this event how often security comes around the next time I went to a pool area. They came to do a round ONCE IN THREE HOURS!  I went to the front desk and spoke to Miranj and Andreu the night manager s who had NO ANSWER except to say \"What would you like me to do?\" from Miranj.  I asked to hear from the general manager but never did.  I could go on about this place but I will not.  Westgate is just not worth the trip.\n",

I saw the person at the front desk pretty much was just chatting with each other or chatting with their favorite customer.

The restaurant is known for its mochi waffle so I ordered a chestnuts mochi waffle with black sugar syrup.   When I cut it up, it was like regular waffle.  No mochi or anything like that in the filling at all.  The waffle is a good size but it only gave me so little syrup. I feel ripped off.\n",

We are owners with Marriott but stayed here in an exchange through Interval International. As soon as we checked in we were taken from person to person to make sure we got our owners discounts even though we were not owners at this resort. However, to do that we would have to sit through a presentation and place a $20 deposit for the breakfast. I have never felt more pressured in my life and have never had to put down money for something that would be \"free\". Let us just say we said no to any discounts because of the horrible sales pressure. Furthermore, wifi costs money and the gym. Really?!! The resort has so many old buildings that they should be updated before guests stay (built in beds, mirrored walls, old carpet, and once entrance for two units.). The pictures on their website do not match what you actually get. Let us just day we will not be exchanging again and will stick with the good quality Marriott resorts offer.\n",

Also tried the Spaghetti al Tartufo Nero - Spaghetti sautéed with black truffle and shaved parmesan in a saffron white wine sauce - and that was vile - the truffles were rubbery and tasteless.  The Medaglioni di Carne - Medallions of beef tenderloin sautéed with black truffle cognac sauce, served with parmesan risotto was just ok.  Thankfully I had a restaurant.com coupon - because this place is expensive ($18 to $26 per entree) for what you get.  You would be much happier at Maggiano's.

As I came alone, the hosted did not give me an option to sit at the many available tables (this should have been my first clue) but instead directed me (without a smile) to sit at the bar or a high top. The problem is I do not drink alcohol but came instead for the seafood.  The name was kind of quirky so it caught my attention. Anyway after being seated at a hightop I sat for quite some time and no one ever came to wait on me. Finally a waitress at the bar noticed I was there and asked if I wanted to see a menu. I responded that I would love that. She put a menu on the bar, even though I was sitting 8 feet away, and just left it there.  That was the last of my interaction with the wait staff. Eventually I just walked out. I cannot help but wonder how many others have had the same experience.\n",

The \"baguette\" was soft and elastic in texture and tasted like Wonder Bread, the extremely small portion of beef was cold, tough and under seasoned - totally lacking in flavor as were the peppers and onions. The chimichurri had the flavor profile of a commercial product manufactured to satisfy middle america rather than being bright and bold as it should be. It added nothing to the overall flavor of the sandwich. The sandwich had no character whatsoever and execution and attention to detail was poor. The parmesan herb french fries that accompanied the sandwich were barely lukewarm and very light on the parmesan and herbs. It is clear that the kitchen staff is lacking in skill and experience and that oversight and overall standards within the kitchen and by the expediter (who appeared to be a manager) are non existent.\n",

Restaurant prices are based on cost of goods, labor cost and operating expenses - including insurance benefits.

            "This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. We were the only table when we were first seated on the patio, and it still took our waiter almost 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders. It took almost 45 minutes to receive our food after ordering, which would have been acceptable if the restaurant was busy, however at this point we were only one of two tables at the restaurant. Our waiter, DONOVAN, never asked us how our food tasted, and never cleared our plates or glasses as we finished our dishes. We had to ask for to-go boxes THREE times before they were given to us. I spoke to the manager about this unacceptable service and he did not seem to care at all. To make matters worse, it took almost another 20 minutes to receive our checks after we initially asked for them. Once we got out checks, we ended up having to go inside to hand the manager our bills ourselves because our waiter was again no where to be found. The manager then took another 10 minutes to process the payments, seeming unapologetic the whole time. On top of all of this, the manager did not give me the exact amount of change for my cash payment. When I approached him about shorting me, he threw another quarter in my hand and said 'sorry' in a rude way. Having an incompetent waiter is one thing, but having management be just as terrible shows that this restaurant does not care about their customers whatsoever.\n",

            "I was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it is not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there is no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There is no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I was not familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it is not packed, there is echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually was not the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\n",

            "Point of the story is, I understand that it is end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i am actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it is end of day and it is not because of their personalities), then do not say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

It smelled and tasted musty. How can I explain it?  Like an old closet filled with old boots and socks... Had it exchanged for broccoli--- which was the same musty, old garbage as the fruit salad-- only in vegetable form. Husband's food not good either-- and fries were mushy and cold. Nothing done to remedy anything except waitress said she did not like the fruit salad either. Oh--And they took 38 cents off the bill for the fruit salad. So disappointing as I just wanted to eat a decent hamburger. It was over-cooked, dry, and luke warm so I think it was leftover from lunch as was my husband's hamburger and fries.   I have been to decent Red Robin's but this was not one of them. Never again-- anywhere.\n",

We eat out frequently and rarely say anything bad about a restaurant - this food was hands down awful.  I am so surprised the former executive chef of One Midtown Kitchen has put out a menu that is simply confused and poorly executed. In all, the food was greasy or over seasoned, almost every dish contained pancetta (even when not listed on the menu) and was over powered by that flavor. Even the cottage fries, which you would think something as simple as fried potatoes could not be too bad, were caked in a homemade season salt that was overpowering/unsavory and clumped when mixed with the grease from the frying ( we had a pool of grease at the bottom of the bowl the fries were served in and the potatoes were served soggy from the grease)\n",

The family style seating has also been poorly executed with tables that are too high for the chairs placed around the- basically it seems like you are sitting in a kindergarten chair which leaves your chest right at the height of the table- particularly awkward and uncomfortable for women.

WTH, good food is not worth extreme rudeness!  Besides it looks like a dump.  I will not return...\n",

            "So a couple of friends and I decided to try this place after hearing how good it was on a Sunday. We came a bit early before they opened about 5 to 10min. There were about 6 or so other people waiting as well. Someone came and unlocked the door at opening and just walked away no opening and greeting. Everyone commented on wow no hello come in. Ok not an big issue . We grabbed a menu and sat down. We promptly ordered and our coffee and deserts came pretty fast. The deserts were tasty but small for the price. The place was full at this time. After sometime our check never came the waitress was scarce to be seen. We finally got our check and put our credit cars on the table. About 15 to 20 min go by and no waitress. She had served a few others but never came by the table. Other people came in and waited a while to even get a order in. I finally went to the kitchen to find someone and said we would like to pay. Two were back there and said she would be out shortly. She came out a few min later saw our cards and told us its cash or check only. Said this is the way for many years. No where on the menu it stated this nor anywhere I saw. She said there was a ATM next door at the Plaid Pantry. Luckily we had cash. Overall it is a cool place. But the service or lack there of just does not make me want to go back. I do not care how hip, cool, or odd it is. You still have to have decent customer service. It felt like they just did not care at all.\n",

            "- The ceviche had miniscule amounts of seafood.  Although it was billed as having mussels and octopus, all I saw was tiny (we are talking the size of a large grain of rice or at most a small pea) unidentifiable rubbery bits--obviously a pre-frozen mix they get by the bag--amid a cupful of diced tomato and onion.  Oh, and one tiny shriveled mussel.  If you want ceviche, a dozen places on Buford Highway will give you a cup brimming with seafood chunks.  Sure, this was a fairly inexpensive appetizer, but I wish they had charged a bit more and given me something that was actually ceviche.\n",
            "- On the shrimp tostada, the shrimp were coated in some sort of totally unnecessary batter and overcooked.  Shrimp on a tostada are not normally fried but rather boiled--gently.\n",
            "- Grilled Caesar salad barely had any char marks on it, and the dressing had no discernible anchovy flavor (or truthfully, flavor of any kind).  I have had some good grilled Caesar salads, but this was not one of them.\n",

Really disappointed.\n",
            "Criminally slow, apathetic, and disorganized service. Two of our party's drinks were missed and only upon reminding them were drinks remade. The quality of coffee served is below average and not worth much remark. Even if you are in the area and think this might be a convenient stop, I highly encourage you to take your money elsewhere. It is just not worth the chance of terribly slow service.\n",

He mistakenly attempted to light it, and when she realized what he had done she flipped out, even after we offered to pay for it, she continued to berate us and  brought another table of people in on it.

All of our food came out at different times, one other was cold and hard, another other never received the side order that was ordered. 2 managers came over and we are very apologetic and offered to comp the tickets. The tickets came and nothing was comped. Then the male manager toook off $4.00 on each ticket. We did not order any alcohol. I asked for him to come back because that was unacceptable. I asked for a number to corporate and he offered to comp half the bill. At this time I was done. I paid and never did get the cooperate number. I e-mailed corporate and was advised to contact someone. Called that person and they did not answer and there was not a voicemail box set up. Emailed him back to ask him to contact me since he did not have a voicemail box and he still has not contacted me. Simply ridiculous and you expect me to pay money to your establishment again. Never!\n",

            "Quite possibly some of the worse pizza I have ever had. I ordered a small cheese pizza and small boneless wings. The pizza had almost no sauce, and there was nothing special about cheese or crust. It was bland at best. I also did not feel like the cheese was very high quality. The boneless wings were soggy, soaked in Buffalo sauce, and the blue cheese was off. The wings could have been soggy because of the breading, however, you could tell that they were never crisp and basically just stuck frozen wings in a microwave and tossed them in sauce. Will absolutely never order from here again despite the convenience of ordering from Foodler.\n",
            "I called 3 times with no answer.   Decided to stop by and order a simple pizza.  There was only 1 person working and I felt like I was putting her out by ordering a pie.

The food was good, but flavor cannot cover up filth and bad service. \n",

Perhaps worse, the major ingredient in the pita was spring mix lettuce. What?! How about some juicy eggplant? Some fresh tomatoes and cucumbers? It is obvious they are cutting costs by not even beginning to provide the kind of sandwich you can get for $5 from a Lebanese or Palestinian restaurant. Will not be back.\n",

I am almost positive that every single person that works there is intoxicated every time they come to work.  Very bad experience and the food is terrible for the prices they charge.  The caesar salad has way to much dressing, the pasta dishes are overcooked and somewhat burnt and the pizza seemed to be made sloppily and without care; the sauce was not spread onto the entire pizza and the toppings were far from evenly spread, to me that is the least you can do for a decent pizza. And I saw that they leave their pizza dough out in the open to dry for a long time, at least an for the hour that i was there, no wonder it tasted stale!!!! Also contrary to their claim it is not a brick oven pizza. I looked into the pizza ovens at one point and they are most certainly not brick ovens.  I worked in a pizza restaurant a long time ago, that had actual brick ovens, and these are definitely not true brick ovens.  From what I could see it appeared to me that they used gas instead of wood or other more natural elements to heat their ovens and from my limited knowledge of pizzerias that is definitely not the way to cook a good pizza. I tried to give bertuccis a chance on a couple occasions but it is nothing but a poorly run chain restaurant with mediocre food and awful service\n",

Our large party was clearly too much for the kitchen to cope with; it took well over an hour for our entrees to appear, all because \"someone ordered a pork chop and that takes 25 minutes to prepare.\" The waitstaff would accept no substitution on a Friday night because \"the chef does not want to be judged on different flavor combinations\".  Really?!  When I asked the manager to produce a salad to offset my plummeting blood sugar, the manager said it would have to go through the standard computer ordering system and hopefully would be out in 5 minutes.  She could not enter the kitchen and ask an emergency order, even if a patron was on the verge of collapse.  No apologies.  Clearly a tavern focused on drinks, not a restaurant focused on food.

We were also told that they had already announced \"last call\" at the bar (which was actually full of people).  We questioned why they would accept a 9:45 reservation, and informed them that there was even a 10:00 option.  After a few minutes of rude treatment, we finally asked to speak with a manager.\n",

I am convinced that he wanted to go home, or perhaps out to party (it was St. Patrick's Day).  He actually did not appear to be very happy when I said, \"I bet the corporate office would love to know that you are closing early.\"  He blamed us for showing up late, and he blamed Open Table for including 10PM as an option.

When we arrive the restaurant is practically empty but they sat us at a small table right between the doors to the bathroom and the kitchen.  We asked if we could have one of the other tables that were empty (because only 2 or 3 other parties were in the whole restaurant) and we were told they were reserved.  By the time we left those tables were still empty!  In fact, a group walked in off the street and were given a table and so if the tables were reserved then how did they get a seat?  (I only know all of this because our table was also right by the host's stand so we could hear everything the host and the waiters bitched and joked about all night)  One more thing about the atmosphere...have they finished decorating?  I hope not.   One wall still had wallpaper that appeared to be from the previous establishment, the lighting was too bright, and the wall hangings were cheap paintings.  They had some nice large mirrors but they hung them almost at the ceiling so you would not even notice them.\n",

I asked the waiter and he insisted it was wonderful.  Not only were the tomatoes lacking flavor, as I was worried about, but even the mozzarella was tasteless.  A waste of the $15 they were charging for it on NYE.  So then the entrees.  One of the specials for the night was a filet mignon with a sauteed mushroom sauce.  When my boyfriend ordered this 5 minutes after the waiter listed the specials for us the waiter stuttered and said that he thought they were out of it.  Huh??  You just told us that was your special 5 minutes ago!  And I know no one was eating it since their was next to no one in the restaurant!  Anyway, and unfortunately, they did have it and I also ordered the lobster ravioli which was to come in a champagne cream sauce.  The lobster must have been canned because it was stringy, not chunks, and had a seafood flavor, not a buttery flavor like good lobster should have.  The sauce was thick and tasteless.  Kind of like watered down glue.  The best part (sarcasm) was the filet though.  The filet was tiny and sliced in half lengthwise so that you got two pieces about 0.25\" thick.  Sort of like a cheap steak used for chicken fried steak or something.  Of course because it was cut so thin it was also way overdone.  The chef insisted it was filet mignon though and although I am not doubting him, it could not have been a good piece of meat to have to cut it up that way.  And then to drown it in that sauce!  The sauce was sort of like a thick stew sauce and the mushrooms were really chewy.  \n",

Even my children noticed he had an attitude . 2ndly he never asked if we wanted a drink. I had to go back after we sat down to get drinks for my children. I asked him if the drinks were included in the meal and he said no, very abruptly. Now why does he think we are going to eat here with no drink. Really? I am very appalled at his attitude and his approach.\n",

He was very snippy, I said, so that is all you have to say...he said Yup and turned and walked away. Not an apology, nothing...We had enough of fighting off the 50 yellow jackets that constantly landed on our drinks, table and us...we paid for our drinks and took our business elsewhere. Steer clear of this spot, FAR to many restaurants in Decatur to be treated like this. I would give 0 stars if I could!!!\n",

I ended up waiting 45 mins for my food. The cashier forgot my order when I called an hour into my take out order. It finally came down to when I had to say something after i saw people getting their food way after I came into the store. The employee only offered a can of soda and apologized when he realized the order was never placed. That is something you cannot settle for. I cannot get that hour back from waiting. No refund or no service of anything, the cashier only said he was sorry because he was busy. Terrible\n",
            "Worst service I have ever experienced. Food was good but when we requested a check, it came as a single one. We are three college students so we asked the waiter to separate the check. She refused to separate the check stating that we should have told her at the start. We were extremely disappointed with the service so we left no tip. Unfortunately, I left my phone at the restaurant so I went back to get it. The waiter demanded I pay her a tip before she gets my phone. After I pay a 5 dollar tip the waiter pulls my phone from her pocket. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!\n",

So I pulled up to the drivethrough window to check the posted hours and see if there was anyone there who could serve me.  By this time it was 11:55.   The posted hours said the drive through is open until midnight.  Inside there were three girls working on cleaning up.  All three of them saw me (and I was visible on the TV monitor mounted inside) so they knew I was there.  One of them even made eye contact.  But they evidently wanted to leave immediately after closing, so they had decided to close down early.  Rather than acknowledging me and telling me they were closed, they just continued cleaning up, and occasionally glancing in my direction to see if I would left.

Management should be paying them for 30 minutes past closing, to allow time for cleanup, and should be enforcing the posted closing times.  The behavior I saw was utterly rude, and terrible for business.  If the management of this restaurant cannot even get their employees to keep the store open, I can only imagine how unsuccessful they might be at maintaining health and hygiene standards.  I will avoid this Wendy's in the future.\n",

The Pad Thai was not prepared the way I have had it done at other Thai restaurants, it was served with more of a vermicelli noodle, not the usual flat style rice noodle, had both chicken and shrimp, no choice given, and though I asked for it to be about medium spicy, it was hardly spiced at all. And the cilantro over powered everything else on the plate. And the Fried Rice had a very sweet taste to it, like the Pork was BBQed with a sweet BBQ sauce. Very unappealing. Guess I should have stuck with one of the Pho dishes or went with the veggie Fried Rice, like I would had before.\n",

I had only one beer in their \"back bar\" and while following my friends towards the front of the bar they herded me towards the front enterance and told me to \"go home\".

Rock shrimp were disappointing, greasy. Chicken flavored rice was OK; coleslaw was passable. Salad greens were lousy (had spent too much time in the bag), dressing was from a little packaged cup. The corn fritters come topped with powdered sugar which was very weird, but the vague fishy flavor turned us off completely. Very weird. Key lime pie was good, though my brother disagreed.

            "UPDATE: Okay, so it has been a few weeks since I tried Zack's in early March. Since then, they have added a large playscape for kids in a fantastic, fenced-in, grassy area. Clearly it is a big draw, as I have seen a lot of kids running around there while the parents drink wine in the evening. So, it is been on my radar to give this place another try. So, last Thursday my wife and I were walking out of the haircut place and it was lunchtime, and we were across from Zack's. We decided to give it another try. This time, the place was packed, which is good. Like I said in my original bad review, I want this place to succeed. Steiner needs another good restaurant, and the last thing we need is more residents to lose big money on a failed restaurant. Anyway, we sit down, and were greeted immediately. I quickly put in an order for a calamari appetizer. We got our drinks, and after awhile, put in our order (more on that in a bit). Finally, after we had been there about 15 minutes, the waiter told us that they had messed up the first calamari and we redoing it. Okay, good sign I guess. When the calamari did come, it ended up coming at the same time as lunch... and it was really not very good. Kind Of like mushy tempura. Nick's Italian restaurant (in the old Flores spot on 620) has calamari that tastes like calamari. This was like bland soggy fishsticks. But that was the least of my problems.\n",

            "I had ordered a hamburger, and I had ordered it \"medium well.\" That means pretty darn cooked. I put some condiments on the bun, took a huge bite, and it was RAW. And I do not mean pink in the middle. And I do not mean rare. I mean -- COLD and RAW. The outside of the buger was browned a bit, enough not to notice, but the inside was flat out raw like steak tartare. I showed the waiter, and he was apologetic enough, and they told me they would get me a new burger. 10 minutes go by, and the waiter serves me a plate with a new bun, and my burger patty - missing the bite - open faced! This burger was sent back covered in a ton of mayo, ketchup and mustard. And it had a big bite out of it, and they cooked it. I could not believe they had scraped off my food with a bite out of it and put it on the grill where they were cooking everyone else's food. Is this even sanitary? I could not believe it and I took a photo, which I have uploaded here, because I was so amazed. Later in the meal, a manager came by and told us that they did not re-grill it, they put it in an oven for 10 minutes. I hope for health reasons he is right, but I am not sure it makes it any better. Who wants a BAKED hamburger with a bite taken out of it? Did they scrape down the patty? Wash it off? Wipe it with a towel? Just cook all that stuff on it into it?

It is real simple: Good food, good service, clean restaurant. Three little things, and they just cannot pull it off. I hope they read this and use it as motivation to improve, because I will say it again: I want this place to succeed. Steiner Ranch needs a good solid restaurant like this.

            "Worst New Year's Eve experience of my life. Aside from the less-than-festive ambiance on the second and third floors, there were only three bartenders on each bar to service hundreds of people. It was a legitimate 20 minute wait for drinks. Once I got to the bar, the bartenders were really great and attentive, but management really did a crappy job staffing the bar and the guests and staff suffered because of it. Oh, and whatever happened to the champagne that we were supposed to get for the midnight toast? Yeah. I will be doing my bowling at King's or some other place. Definitely not going back to Jillian's again.\n",

We sat down to only a lunch menu, had to ask for the happy hour menu and when I did the server was extremely rude and put off. Then she informs me \"do not order anything fried because our frier is broken\" we were both taken back and decided to leave before ordering\n",
            "We visited Bacco before a show on a Saturday evening. The staff was lovely however the food was a complete disappointment. I had Veal Saltimbocca that was sitting on top of 2 cold, soggy ravioli. The sauce was barely edible. Everyone else at the table also received cold food but the flavors were better than my dish. We asked for dessert menus as we did not finish our meals but were told no dessert was being offered that evening.  I will not return.\n",
            "NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY. If you have small children do not even think about coming here. We visited this evening around 6:30 there was a lot of open and we were told to just seat ourselves. We picked an end table because we had stroller and upon seating ourselves a woman with red dyed hair came out and told us that she did not like our stroller at the end of the table and to find another spot. We were a party of four and a baby and her ONLY suggestion was that my uncle sit by himself on another table. BY HIMSELF. So we switched the stroller to where the chair was so that my uncle could sit at the end of the table. Then the lady with the red hair came out again and told us that it was a liability to sit at the end of the table and she was not comfortable with it. Again she made no suggestions. So my mom asked if she would \"feel\" better if we moved the stroller by the wall and she said \"that would be great\". A line started to form and she asked if she could move my stroller \"over there\". I told her it was okay not knowing that \"over there\" meant in the hallway next to the bathroom, bus cart, and TRASH. Another young family came in with their stroller and they were asked to sit outside in the cold with their baby even there were tables and chairs available inside. I honestly think this situation could have been handled with more finesse. The concern of being at the end of the table as a liability was because hot soup was being carried around but no matter where you sat hot soup was being carried over people's heads. We probably would have left had not been for the long day of airline travel and droving we had and the need to just eat something. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the end, we finally got situated.. Our food was ok. The noodles tasted starchy and the chicken karaage we were served was slightly cold. We wanted to like this place SO BAD but sadly we probably will not return because we do not want to be an inconvenience or a liability.\n",

            "\n",
            "Food comes out suspiciously fast. My soup was obviously straight from a can and pretty disgusting. Veggies were absolute mush and the consistency of the soup was gloppy. For $9 I was expecting the sandwich to actually have a slice of turkey breast on it but it was more like Carl buddig cheap bologni-ish lunch meat on a slice of wonder bread with some instant gravy. My dining partner's food was obviously those frozen Tyson chicken popper things you get at the grocery store and were still frozen in the middle, had to send them back to be re-microwaved. \n",

Mediocre food, overpriced (no dinner appetizer less than $10, basic noodle/rice dishes start at $14-16, entrees $20-30), made worse by unfriendly and inattentive service, AND a ridiculous wait for food - so slow that the couple next to us gave up and asked for their entrees to go as they were with two young children who were at wit's end. Never again.\n",
            "The manager of this establishment is a total tots. Has no sense of costumer service and I am convinced he spits in the tacos.\n",

            "My co-workers and I visited Southern Smoke since we love BBQ and are always looking for new places to try for lunch. I ordered the brisket sandwich with two sides (lunch special) for around $8.00 that includes no drink. I am a native Texan so I know a good brisket when I see one. We returned to the office with eats in hand and upon closer review, the brisket sandwich was covered with onions and cheese which was something I have never seen before but was willing to give it a shot. I took one bite of the sandwich and threw the rest of it away. It was simply the worst brisket I have ever eaten. It was meat with poor flavor and I think I would have been happier with meat that had no flavor. I opted for the baked mac and cheese and the cornbread  for my sides and took a bite of both and promptly discarded both sides in the trash can. I was hoping to have some decent BBQ and was so disappointed. The portion of meat on the sandwich was good but the taste was simply bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will never waste $7-8 dollars on a meal that does not come with a drink.\n",
            "everyone needs to know that the problem is not the people who work there, the problem is the owner of the place, a guy who only thinks about money, does not mind exploiting their employees and pay them very little, the owner of the place comes $ 2.00 for each delivery for the cualea are nothing for the driver ... think 2 times before ordering pizza from this place.\n",
            "Just do not. There are plenty other Thai restaurants and places in Somerville to spend your money. Terrible pad thai.\n",
            "I thought I had found the place to go for large parties. Party of 14 and they seated within 15 minutes. Found out they take reservations!! Thought fantastic!\n",
            "Assumed the food would be decent, just like all the many times I have been to Claim Jumper in southern California. Boy was I wrong. The food was not good. Almost everything was sub-par or some of it was just gross.\n",
            "\n",
            "The artichoke dip was sweet... and had traces of? nutmeg? No one ate it. They even gave us a second one... it was still the same. Most of the party had food that they did not finish b/c it was not good.My ahi tuna salad was just ok. The only thing I liked was the potato cheesecakes. Those were still good.\n",

            "We started with edamame and the bang bang shrimp their signature app. The edamame was left in the bag when it arrived. The shrimp was good but very small portion. They brought out bread that fell apart. The clam chowder was very thick and mostly potatoes no clams. I ordered the Blackened Baja fish tacos.  What they brought me was salmon tacos. When I asked the server why they did that he replied I do not know.  Easily one of the worst timing experiences we have ever had.\n",
            "What pizza place does not give the option to have onion as a topping!? I do not want your onion mix, just regular onions, and stop telling me it has always been this way.  IT HAS NOT! I have ordering just onions from this place for 10+ years.  I get just regular onions at every other Papa Murphy's I order from.  Also when I tell you I do not want onion mix in my pizza DO NOT put it on it! My goodness how hard is it to make take out pizza?  I am thinkin'...uh... not very. I absolutely agree with Sarah G. customer service is awful and perhaps I had my pizza made by the same person.  The owner should really review this, she was so hasty in making the pizza she was wasting more toppings than were going onto the pizza. Thank goodness there is one on Lombard not too far.  I can get just onion and have it made for me attitude free.\n",
            "I will not come here again, the atmosphere is different. Cannot blame the waitstaff, it is obviously the kitchen staff that need more structure or CLEANING! The food was horrible. We ordered fried pickles and the pickles were soaked in what looked like dirty grease .  They were not crispy. The mango chili chicken had no flavor. The broccoli was brown and so was the avocado.\n",
            "How do I sum this up?  Well, you have got terrible karaoke blasting in your ear as everyone around you sucks down on scorpion bowls the size of planters (which must be held by 2 hands)and nibbling infamously dubious chicken on a stick. o_O  If it is your first time (as it was mine), the only appropriate reaction seems to be shock and/or bewilderment.  The  good thing is that there is usually no cover, so you can \"pre-game\" here before heading next door to Sissy K's (which is at least 1 step up from HK) for more karaoke or one of the other slightly classier alcoholic institutions located within historic Faneuil Hall.\n",
            "I visited this restaurant for the second time recently, the first time I went they were relatively new and it was average, went back after they had redone the place, thought I would give it another try and man what an overpriced disappointment. Cool atmosphere, nice location and good service but if your going to have an Italian restaurant in the north end of Boston, at least know what you are doing with some of the italian staples.\n",
            "If you do decide to check it out, sit outside, have a cocktail and some of that crusty bread, the rest of the menu is extremely overpriced for such small portions; for example the beet salad aka the beet down salad, its literally a scoop of goat cheese, 4 beet slices and a couple pieces of arugula scattered on top with a drizzle of dressing, some salad. I have had several items on the menu, look out for the pappardelle bolognese, very different presentation then any bolognese I have ever had but the sauce tasted like bad meat, very poor. Do not even get me started on that meat and cheese board with meats that I have not seen since 4th grade. They should just throw the olive loaf on there. The majority of the items on the menu are extremely deceiving descriptions of what you are anticipating on getting. Never again!!\n",
            "I have been to Sage several times. Today I decided to come here for Mothers Day. We came two years ago for Mothers Day and the food was great. Well, today...not so much. First let me start with saying that they have changed their menu for Mothers Day. Therefore the things that I had my mind set on, were not on this menu. Disappointed, but no biggie. Second, we noticed that other tables had bread, we had to ask for it. I had ordered the chicken and waffles. Well, approximately 1/2 way through my meal I pulled a piece of blonde hair from my mouth...my hair is black. Disgusting to say the least. I informed the server, and he said oh wow. Let me take that away. He came back about 5 minutes later and asked me if I wanted them to make it over. Um, no thanks. At this point I am thoroughly disgusted...not to mention, it is Mothers Day! He comes back and asks if we would like to order some dessert...No.  He then returns with the bill and said he removed the chicken and waffles. Considering it had hair in it, I would think that you would!!!  A manager never came to the table to apologize. Overall the service was crappy, food, well a bit on the hairy side. I think it is safe to say that I will not be back.\n",

Not an exaggeration, I have had a way better pie at Papa Gino's.  Huge letdown, but I may give it another shot when the wait/crowds die down.\n",

Granted, I have not been there in quite a while so it might have changed by now but I remember the cheese tasting cheep and being very oily. The crust seemed very limp like it was not cooked long enough but I could be wrong.\n",

            "Authentic chinese food and great flavor... so why the 1 star review? My wife and I have eaten here several times since they just opened within the past year... we figured they would have some bugs to work out, but enough is enough. They have been open long enough and they cannot seem to work it out for this location. Our experience last night was,yet again, so disappointing. We ordered 2 dishes. Chili chicken and Singapore style noodles. After waiting longer than usual (mind you the place was half full) the chili chicken came out and instead of the usual crispy and flavorful chicken we are accustomed to, it was cold and chewy. I asked our waitress to re-cook the dish, after explaining it was cold and chewy, which she obliged. After another extended wait, the chili chicken came out and it was hot and crispy. As she dropped off the dish, I asked her to please check on our other order (singapore style noodles), she said she would. She stopped by after a few minutes and mentioned she asked the chef to cook it quicker. After another extended wait and mind you by this time or chili chicken was finished, I figured it was not worth waiting any longer. I paid my check and explained I did not want to wait any longer. All the waiter could tell me was they had a new cook and was missing orders. Really? We were not the only table experiencing the extended wait times. I am done with this location! If you like their food, go to their location that is closer to downtown.\n",
            "The manager prepared my sandwich order incorrectly. She did not follow the online order's instructions for my order. My sandwich was missing ingredients. I respectfully raised the issue with the manager. She became aggressive and treated me rudely. Immediately after that, I left to avoid any other potential conflicts. Customers should not be treated rudely. D'Angelo should better train their managers and other employees. No wonder restaurants loose customers and thus revenue.\n",
            "On vacation from NY. We googled Spanish foods places to eat. And found número uno. Omg the air conditioner was blasting. Being a small place it felt so cold that the food turned cold on the plate. My husband asked for a fish he said it tasted like cardboard. My daughter asked for Fried chicken and she got chicken stewed. I asked for green plantains and got sweet ones. My son as a joke asked for a beer and he was not ID. He was given a beer. Food was tasteless !!!! Never again on the way to Boca Raton Florida to finish our vacation. Cannot wait to eat at our favorite place down there. Little Havana restaurant here we come !\n",
            "Worst service ever! My husband and I went to this place and for the first time in my life, I walked out of a restaurant. We had to wait 15 minutes to flag down a busboy for coffee -- and after over 40 minutes, when we could not get an answer from two people as to why eggs would take so long to cook, our food arrived. And it was the wrong order.\n",

Then he changes it into another half rotten avocado - which I only noticed once starting to eat. I asked for a refund on the avocado -$2.09-since I do not eat rotten food. Server and then manager got into a heated argument with me in front of other customers. Here is pic of rotten avocado that they keep in their fridge and serve to customers.\n",
            "This past  Friday, we arrived promptly at 5:00 and gave our name to the hostess, \"party of 2\".  She advised us that it would take 5 to 10 minutes, so we went outside and waited.  I went back inside to check with her after 20 minutes had passed and she assured me that there was a couple in front of us and we would be next.  I went outside and got my friend to go inside and wait in front of the hostess station (since we were next to be seated).  After about ten more minutes of waiting, one of the hostess came to advise us that they no longer had a table for us and it would be an additional hour and a half wait.  We were both very unhappy. If we had not been told when we first arrived at 5:00 that it would only be a 5 to 10 minute wait, that would have been very different.  But to have then waited a half an hour and then advised that it would be an additional hour and a half is just plain unacceptable and very unprofessional.  I expected much more from Uchiko.  One very unhappy customer.\n",

            "Secondly, because of the lack of staff, there was a long queue with people waiting WHILE the world cup has already started. There were plenty of tables available, but not enough staff to take care of everything. When our turn to be seated finally came and the hostess/waitress was ready to take us to our table, the manager abruptly interrupted her, completely ignoring the fact that she was taking care of her clients. He did not even apologize.\n",

When I asked her if we could move a table that was already half way out the door she rudely replied, \"yeah...we do not do that.\"  I have eaten here several times before and since the food was good, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and told her we would wait for another table to open up. We stood where she told us too, which happened to be in the way of another waitress who then rolled her eyes at us after we accidentally blocked her path. We immediately left and will not be back!\n",

My mom then told him that we have an 8:30 reservation, he then asked us what time it was and we told him 8:45. He then pointed to a random table in the back corner and said to \"go sit there and by the way we close in 15 minutes\" . My mom the. Got upset and stated why would you accept a reservation for 8:30 if you close I. 15 minutes? He then shrugged at us and walked away. We looked at the time on the door and it stated the restaurant closed at 10 and another employee also confirmed that they closed at 10.

I found out the next day that it also happened to our friends.  It is an easy fix to avoid the mixup but they do not display the sizes just to scam people. On top of that our pizzas were raw. I plan to also write to corporate about our experience with them. Manager was plain awful.  He knew we were tourists and took advantage of that. AVOID.\n",

While we were discussing what we were going to order, my cousins and I saw a HUGE cockroach walking along the walls.  As our waiter walked by, he saw it and stopped and then kept on walking, as if he never saw it.  We then tried to get his attention.  We told him that the cockroach was on the serving tray.  He took the tray, without saying a word and just gave it to one of the bartenders.  UGH!!!  He then ignored us for a while, until we told him that we were ready to order.  At then end of our meal, my aunt felt something on her leg.  We dismissed it until my sister and two cousins also felt something.  By the way, there was a hole in the booth where we were sitting.  We paid our meal, and the waiter never acknowledged the cockroach.  We decided to talk to the manager, and he did not apologize, either.  He just dismissed us.  We will never be going  back to Baby A's.  Do not remember if the food was any good.  All we remember is the HUGE cockroach and the dismissal of the employees and manager.\n",
            "So me and my wife came in this Olive Garden on may 28th right around 2pm . We were greeted by the he hostess in a professional way and told us it was a 5-10 min wait. After we got our buzzer it went down hill fast! We went to the bar to get our drinks we sit down in front of Renee the bartender and the first thing she says is \"if you all are drinking I need to see your ID\" well I did not even order anything yet and she could not even say hi how are you. I felt like I was being discriminated because I am 24 and look younger, So I gave her my ID and I ordered a miller bottle, she said we do not have miller we have miller lite , and I told her that is what I ordered that there is no such thing as \"miller\" well she got into an argument with me saying there is etc she then told us \" I am a bartender honey I know more then you\". That is when a grabbed a manger. The manager cake over wearing a bright blue shirt, he never said his name. I told him the story and he said I will get you sat and give you a gift card. We then get sat and he says give the card to your server, and he never checked back with us about food or anything. Christian the server comes over and he was GREAT! Good came out amazing and then when we were paying it went down hill again! I have the server our gift card and he comes back 5 mins later asking where we got this? I told him m the manager and he said okay I will be right back. 25 mins go by and the server comes back over asking if the manager came to talk to me and they did not. So I wait another 5 mins for Vincent to come over and he also asked where did the get the gift card and if I can explain what happen again!.......... like there must be no communication between the managers. Well he apologized again and said he will take care of the whole check since that is what should have been done. Overall the food and sever where great. The bartender killed out experience. I am also a restaurant manager and if that was my employee or my manager giving out gift cards and not communicating they would be fired. I really hope you guys fixed you se vice here. Hope to hear from someone hire up\n",

            "This place is horrible. Everything tastes fake and/or  premade by the cheapest wholesale store they could find. We tried both the pizza and the Asian fare, and we threw away 3/4 of both. I think the other reviews must be friends of the owner, or possibly posted to the wrong restaurant. Please heed my warning, learn from our mistake and do not fall for this \"novelty fusion.\" If you have a single taste bud in your mouth, you will regret it.\n",

As far as the food it was average. HO HO WAS A BIG NO NO\n",
            "Wow... the food was decent, but the service was utterly terrible.  We noticed we had been given the wrong check and told the waitress, after she had tried several times to rush us to pay as we finished eating.   She and several others argued for about 7 minutes, after which she brought us a handwritten check and told us we had to pay in cash because they had lost the check.  We tried to explain how patently ridiculous this was, though she did not seem to understand.  After a minute of discussion, she went back to huddle with the others.  A full TWENTY minutes later, we got a machine printed check and were able to leave.  Also, she never refilled our water glasses, despite our request.  Incidentally, they also messed up the order of the table next to us.  Maybe this was a fluke, but we will certainly not be returning to this restaurant.\n",

I stopped eating in because it always took forever, so today I called in an order to go. One order of sesame chicken and seafood puffs. $14; ready in 30 mins. As I knew that their kitchen tends to be delayed I decided to arrive five minutes after the quoted time. The cashier took my money and said it would be right out, I asked how long and he said \"five mins\" (without physically moving or speaking with anyone). Then I waited for 30 MINUTES before I asked for my money back... Which took another five minutes to find the manager... At which point they said my order was finally ready. \"Do you still want your food?\" I replied \"YES\" as I lay my head on the bar top in defeat. \n",

I said, \"Excuse me, I do not think that addressing me as your \"homegirl\" is very professional. I would even go as far as to say that it is bad service. I do not see other people being greeted in that same manner. In fact, I do not even use homegirl in my vernacular unlike your assumptive waiting practice is suggesting. I know you probably did not even realize you were doing it, but I just want you to know that it is unacceptable and it needs to stop. Take it as a lesson learned for future tables.\" \n",

And all of sudden, 3 or 4 managers came into the space to \"hang out\" \"shoot the $hit\" or whatever they were doing. I feel like they were on a counter defense technique to keep me away from the scared and sad waitress. So instead of addressing the customer in the room with the problem, they basically ignored me and provided some type of unnecessary defense shield. \n",

They did not ask me if I wanted dessert, they did not check up on my meal status, they did not even address my concerns with the waitress that disappeared OR even tell me that they were taking care of my check now. It was totally unprofessional and cowardly. I addressed this woman in a very controlled and assertive way. Yet, the Pelon's staff treated me as if I was a problem.

At Pelon's, the customer is not everything. In fact, the waiters have a lot more weight than any guest investing time, money, and reputation into their establishment could ever have. Needless to say, I will not be going back. And to this one particular sheepish waitress who had a chance to redeem herself by apologizing, acknowledging my dissatisfaction, and moving forward (like the adults we are), shame on you for flipping my suggestion into your problem. I know you meant nothing by your actions, but I wanted you to know that I felt uncomfortable and felt like you were stereotyping me. However, you felt threatened by my soft demeanor. Namaste to you.

High pressure sale tactics and extremely rude when my parents did not want to buy a 5 bedroom condo, ONE week every other year for $139,000!!  Then after all that, they would not sell them the Universal tickets!!!  It was like pulling teeth to get their money back even after 2 hours of listening!  Was this because they would not buy?  That would be my guess. How fair is that?  Bait & switch going on here?

So I asked for another cup, she did not answer and walked away to get our food, so I assumed she did not here me.  When she came back with our food I asked for another cup again.  She did not answer me, looked at another employee and asked her (in Spanish) if she could give me another cup because we dropped the first one, to which the employee replied yes.  This made me very upset!  I know WE were the ones to drop the cup, but seriously!   I should not have even had to ask for another cup, it should have been offered!  I am a Registered Nurse, and if one of my patients dropped their medicine cup on the floor I am not going to expect them to still use it!  That is nasty!

They had 4 people working but only the tall sullen guy was taking orders. The other 3 were mostly hiding in the kitchen.  The food came out at 824pm and our water glasses were finally filled after that.  The combo plate at $16.95 was horrible.  Tiny portions of 4-5 items, all mediocre.  The goat curry were 2 pieces of very bony gristly meat - gross.  The lamb curry was dry as leather and had 5 small cubes for $13.95.  The shrimp chow mein (do not ask) was a bowl of mostly cabbage and onions with very little noodles and 2 small shrimp.  Terrible service, not good food.  What a waste of a Friday night and $46.\n",

No idea what we did wrong. The plates were threw heavily on to our table. Horrible experience, I will definitely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to have a pleasant dining experience.

It came with a mound of chocolate chips on top (not baked in the batter). on another occasion,  I asked then to please not put butter or powdered sugar on her pancake, it came mounded with powdered sugar and when I returned it, they simply turned it over on the plate so that the powered sugar was on the bottom, unseen.

Everything is frozen not fresh.  Everything from breakfast to dinner all frozen food.  Not what you would expect on a resort property.

There are lot of other good options around, even in late night.\n",

Way to go management! People including myself were waiting 40 + minutes for drinks and even longer for food.

Even so when they messed up my order last time I got an apology and was told when I called to complain that they made me a new order but I had left before it  came out. No one told me they were fixing the order. After maybe 3 months without a visit I called in an order. When I arrived to lock it up I was told that they did not have an order for me and I did not call it in. I reminded the manager, the woman with whom I placed the order today that this was the second time out of 2 visits that I had had a problem. She smiled and nodded but offered nothing else. When I pressed it she offered extra wings. I was out on a break from work and could not afford the extra time it takes to make wings extra crispy from scratch. Will not b back.

We are all freezing our asses at this point. There is plenty of room inside but my guess is that they are trying to be \"exclusive\" but it looks like a dinky less than average bar. We tried to talk to him but he replied with \"wait outside, we will let you know when WE ARE ready.\" We all left at this point regardless that we were next in line to go in and willing to buy at least 3 drinks each.

I never complain but this time I am because I had workers at my house and wanted to feed them. So when I called she said she will adjust the price. That was fine with me. Once the delivery finally showed up, the original price was still on the box and he had no idea about the price change. I only hope he got his tip because I gave him enough to cover the reduction with his tip. Lesson learned next time I will order online so if a mistake is made it will have to be my entry.\n",

Then right after that, the main cook was using the pot filler above the stove to fill up a pot and he rinsed his bare hands under the water then kept filling up the pot! I thought maybe he was going to pour the water out but he proceeded to cook with the same water he rinsed his hands into. No way will I ever eat there. These are just things I witnessed.

The service was good but the food did not match the price. We have eaten at many fine restaurants but this did not live up to its hype. We were told by others that they had a nice jazz piano bar which was no where to be found but we did hear unruly kids. Not a good experience for a 30th anniversary.\n",

            "We went there two times within the last 3 months of visiting Orlando. The first time was on a weekday and was not so busy. The owner who is also one of the chefs really was a pleasure to talk to and really enjoyed the experience first time around thus we did not hesitate when we made our second trip up to Orlando on Christmas Day. The second time around was far more disappointing. They were busy which is a good sign but the waitress that served us was a young female. She was nice and food was ok this time around. We got a steamed fish just like the first time but this time fish was not as fresh. However we ate it and we wanted to call it a night. When the check came, the waitress left the bill on the table and we were surprised thinking the bill was going to come out to $70 but it came out close to $90. When we looked closely at the bill we asked her what the extra $13 charge was on the bottom. She stated that was the tip. How do you charge tip for 2 adults and a toddler?!?! Our families have owned 5 Chinese restaurants between me and my husband and we would never dare charge tip for customers unless it is a bigger party of people and stated on the menu in advance. And on top of it, if you charge us what about the other tables that she served?! Funny thing is after we confronted her she never showed her face again. If you are going to charge for tip you should make it known on the bill and write tip next to it because it is plain embarrassing if the customers confront you about it. If you read some past reviews apparently this has happened to previous customers so please BEWARE!!!! This definitely left a bad impression to us and we highly doubt we will ever visit again when coming in from out of town.\n",

I saw so many good reviews & I am starting to wonder if any of these people ever had real ramen before.  I got the Miso Ramen & I might as well have had water as the broth.  It was so bland & watery, there was nothing miso about it.  Also, the ramen noodles looked & tasted like they had came out of a Top Ramen package.  I was disappointed.  If I was not so hungry when I got it I would have probably just tossed it but I ate it fast so I did not have to taste it.  If your looking for authentic ramen, this is not the place.\n",

It might be great one day and disgusting the next. The waitresses, in general, are not great (often arguing with me over an item I am allergic to, saying it is not in the rolls, and then it comes with that item in there). The service in general is just really poor. They sometimes forget to bring items we have ordered and then argue when we try to get it off the bill. Also, we have ordered a couple of times to go and they will say 20-30 minutes and it still will not be ready over an hour later. We have stopped going because it is gone downhill so much.

It looks like they went to a garage sale and bought anything with a pineapple on it and put on their wall. (Nothing matches) The floors are all carpet which makes the whole place smell like a stale version off their poor food. Speaking of the food it took them an hour to bring me my \"medium\" burger which came out as dry and colored as a hockey puck with a couple of over ripe toppings. For $11 definitely over priced, tasted like a ball park burger cooked in the back of truck for $3. (Burned) The \"rare\" steak tips were no better and half of us did not get the correct sides. We waited another 30 minutes after we got our food for mixed vegetables that were supposed to come out with the meal. When they did finally come the waitress said \"this is just to put some color on your plate\" and plopped down a side dish with 4 burnt slices of squash..... Not a joke at all. The waitress spoke to all of as if it was our first time at a restaurant giving us detailed instructions on how to pay and how she would take our orders. Not to mention she had a horrible odor about her. The entire place is understaffed and poorly staffed has bad food quality and bad cooking procedures. THIS PLACE NEEDS AN UPDATE. Has potential but at the moment it is complete garbage.\n",
            "Worst Customer Service EVER!\n",
            "\n",
            "I had really wanted to write a review of the Matchstick Cafe which gave them high marks for their incredible baked goods and their nice interior, but customer service is really important to me, and that is why they are only getting one star. \n",
            "\n",
            "I will relay my most recent experience and why I will likely not return: I was out running errands one afternoon last week, and though I was not in the neighbourhood, I decided to take a detour to Matchstick because I was really craving one of their double-baked almond croissants (a past favourite of mine). As I entered and approached the display case, I was initially disappointed because it looked as though they had completely sold out of croissants - bummer! - but was then very excited to see a whole tray of them sitting out for all to see on the counter behind the case. At this point, I happily asked the guy at the point of sale terminal for one of the croissants and was completely floored by his reply, \"You cannot have one, those are for tomorrow\". \n",
            "\n",
            "I told him that I had made a special trip to Matchstick for one of those croissants (that were sitting right there staring at me!) and all I got was another \"You cannot have one, those are for tomorrow\". I then tried to appeal to his logical sensibilities by explaining that I was a paying customer here right now, looking at the croissants right there, and that whether they sold one today or tomorrow, it really did not matter. He just kept annoyingly repeating his mantra of \"You cannot have one, those are for tomorrow\" and then walked away leaving me alone at the till. \n",
            "\n",
            "At that point I was understandably fuming at this pedantic, \"those are the rules\" attitude. Firstly, the guy was refusing a potential paying customer - and for no real reason. Secondly, would it have really killed the guy to be nice to someone who had made a special trip to his store? Thirdly, do not keep the baked goods out on the counter where everyone can see them if you do not intend to sell them - it is pretty simple!\n",
            "\n",
            "So, in the end, what did this \"those are for tomorrow\" rule accomplish? I have since found another place with equally fantastic baked goods and much friendlier, less pretentious staff - something I would not have looked for otherwise. My husband, who often stopped at Matchstick on his way to work (but had had his own negative customer service experiences) figured this was the final nail in the coffin for him and likely will not go back. I have also been telling a lot of friends about this experience and they are not impressed either.\n",

I did not want to cause a scene, so I said you do not need to say that, we are really calm right now, and I ended it with you are very rude and that was uncalled for.

The only service provided was literally taking the order, bringing our food, taking our plates after we insisted, and bringing our tab.

She did not even place them in front of us, she put one at the top of the table then spilled the one in front of me multiple times. (The rest of our party received glasses with ice and lemons on the side) But that is not nearly the problem, we were with a party of about 10-15 people and our orders were all taken separately. We were split into three different tables so my table only consisted of my cousin and I. TWO PEOPLE. By the time she FINALLY brought out the pineapple juice and moscato 95% of our party had been served their entrees. When asked why our order was not taken she said she has a separate section and did not realize we were ready to order, mind you it is been at least 45mins. She finally takes our order and every who had received their food has finished eating, the live band is playing and we STILL had not received our food. We called over the manager who said he would go check out what is going on in the kitchen, he did not even come back to our table to update us until we made eye contact from across  the bar.  The waitress even admitted that the kitchen was \"a hot ass mess\". At this point it has been an hour and a half, we really had high hopes for this food and we had been looking forward to it all day. The manager was not accommodating in anyway, they still made us pay for our drinks plus a 5.00 entertainment fee. Do you think I was enjoying any entertainment when I was sitting there with my stomach growling? The least you could do is offer my free pineapple juice !! Cheap people! We cancelled our order and went to a place down the street where our food came out in 20mins. Really ruined our night that we planned to spend eating and fellowshipping with family and friends.

My husband who eats anything, and I mean anything, said it was bad. I mean when he says it is bad it is BAD. I do not think I would have ate any of it if it was not so late and I were not so hungry.

Well we came buy every day and they have been closed ,finally Saturday  nite we show up at 7:30 pm and they are finally open so we walk up to the window and ask for a sample the guy tells me \"we are not doing it any more sorry no more samples .\" I ask him how can you not give any samples if you have not even been open all week and close Sunday he says we just are not sorry ! First of all why enter the contest and expect to win $10000 first place prize if you turn everyone down or dnt even open at all ! Second problem I almost pressed the redeem button which would have gave him credit for giving us a a free sample apparently this is how they get reimbursed. Basically he gives nothing and gets credit for it as if he had . This kind of customer service is what drives people away why even be in the food industry when you are not out to give potential future customers any of your so called awesome food that is the opposite of hospitality. No vote for you mama v thanks for nada!\n",

Then a bit later someone who appeared to be manager came by and asked how everything is going. We thought she was kidding but it seems she had not been told so we told her and she said they get their bags of salad from someone else. Then she offered us a salad to go. We declined and she left.

Second round was alright but my mothers glass was replaced with a new drink and had something gross out the outside. The entire time the waitress has been darting off and different staff is bringing us our food. There were times when..we were waiting for food and could not recall what items.

We sat outside which could be cool if your table was not in dirt. We had flip flops on and our feet were covered in dirt. The service was slow, the food was blah and the belly dancer was awful. I asked for sliced cucumbers for my hummus and the server told me they did not have any...I asked how they made the tzaziki and he informed me they do not make it themselves. Ok so the food is not fresh nor made there and the atmosphere was dull yet they charge $17 for a small kebab plate.  I do not get it. What a shame cuz there are no Mediterranean restaurants in Austin and they could have something great! I have yet to find a restaurant in this city to brag about. Disappointment\n",
            "The service was fast but the food was bland and nothing special.  For a diner, 28$ for a meal for two of mediocre food at best, is just WAY too much.

But the deal breaker for me was the customer service. Long story short, she took the wrong order and came back with an extra pho we did not order. Instead of owning up to it and being courteous to us- the customers, she came back twice to state rudely to us saying that she was right and blamed us for her mistake. Both times she was saying these rude comments very quickly as she was walking away so we could not even have a chance to explain to her why the problem occurred. I am usually very easy going and not the type to make a fuss out of something unless it felt really wrong, but this honestly was one of the worst customer service I have had in a long time. If you do not want your day/evening spoiled, then I would recommend highly to STAY AWAY from this place!!\n",

Seriously.....then her words are, \"If it is more than 90 minutes prepare to be towed.\" WOW! And her counterpart (big mafia-type man with grey hair and Hitchcock body type) will follow you and make sure you are going into the restaurant.  So, that sets the tone. The floors are sticky, the tables are sticky, and the waitresses are rude. Might be overlooked if the food were good -- or at least, if it did not make you sick. Food poisoning is not fun. Granted, I tried this place three times, and only got food poisoning on the last try, but I will not be back.\n",

It has been over a week and no one has made any attempt to follow up with me via phone or email nor have I received a refund of my money or an attempt to rectify the situation. They obviously have no concern for their customers or the fact that they stole my money. I will be contacting my Bank to void the charge and follow up, but this is an unacceptable and unethical way to do business.

The mac and cheese has chewy unappealing pork belly in it - God forbid they just use delicious crispy bacon.  The chicken sandwich is actually one of the few normal good things on the menu, but they do not have ranch or honey mustard - they make their own sauces that are not good (there is a buttermilk dill sauce that is a terrible substitute for just plain old good quality ranch dressing).  \n",

After placing the order with the host I got a call back because THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE KALE OFF MY BREAKFAST SANDWICH!!

Only two forms of PHOTO ID would do for such a fine establishment. College youngins' steer clear if you are thinking about getting a beer here. I honestly enjoyed my experience at this bar. Dodgy but fun atmosphere, good music, a nice beer selection, even fried pickles, but this 2 PHOTO ID policy made me so angry I took to social media. Costello's owners lost out on about $100+ bar tab, including generous tips for their staff, between my 10 friends and I because of that rule. Wicked awesome move guys!\n",
            "Our service was less than satisfactory. We switched tables and because of that we were not accommodated. We waited for someone to even come to take our drink order for at least 20 minutes. When the waiter finally did come to take our drink order he informed us that he was not our waiter. It took over at least 30 minutes for us to receive our food in which some French fries were not fresh and they were cold. Not once did anyone come to ask if we needed refills or needed anything. We had to flag someone down in order for someone to come to our table at all. It was very frustrating to find that we were not granted the proper service. We asked for a refill on water and that took at least 10 minutes! We never got clarification on who our server was and when we complained to the manager Ted he was less than empathetic and seemed uninterested in what we had to say at all and insinuated that it was our fault because we switched tables. My chicken tenders had a bone in them and it immediately became less than appetizing. We explained that we were unaware of who our server was and proceeded to give excuses as to why we received the service that we received. I was not satisfied with the service at all. Finally as we are leaving the waitress did not have any change and had the nerve to ask if we wanted the change. This service was absolutely and unequivocally TERRIBLE! I will not be back to eat at this establishment.\n",

From the salad and stuff the lady that brought our food noticed and played it off but did not Even attempt to clear up the table,  I had to stack up all the plates so she can  give us our dinner,  honestly this has been the worse experience at Olive Garden and what is sad it was not even busy.  I WILL NOT COME BACK THERE AGAIN!!!\n",

Me and my wife visited this place for SXSW one year and the guy and our waitress behind the bar had a very bad attitude like they hated there job and did not want to be there and were bothered by us ordering food. So we decided to take a chance on it anyways because this place looked appetizing but it was a real disappointment. I ended up getting the smoked chicken wings and they were over cooked and dry my wife got the sliced smoked turkey and the loaded fries. The turkey was cut thick and was also dry the french fries were cold and the pulled pork was dry also. It was such an awful experience all around and we will not be going back.\n",

The server finally asked the manager to come over to our table.\n",

I asked my waitress to check with the chef and ask why suddenly my sashimi had changed in size so drastically and she came and told me that the \"chef said sashimi prices went up so they have to cut the pieces smaller\"........what kind of an answer is that?!?! I have been a loyal customer for years and suddenly they cut the pieces into 1/3 of what they used to and still charge the same. It is like, raise the prices if you cannot afford it but do not expect customers to be okay with short changing them and acting like it is not a big deal. Absurd. I am very disappointed, and I have vowed to not return and my friends know about this too and have no plans to go back either.\n",
            "Short staffed and extremely busy. Dirty and has bad service. My waitress seemed high on drugs, which is sad. Otherwise, the food was delicious as it always is at Denny's.

When the company that owns Red Lobster bought Eddie's I was concerned, but the next four or five times we went, it was still great.  The last two times I have been, it was not good.  Tasteless shrimp, so so steak, horrible scallops (to make it worse I forgot how bad they were and ordered them again! As a 16.00 add on.)Nothing like 8 dollar scallops served on a 150 degree steak plate with citrus!  They are slowly getting rid of the great dishes (tuna with wasabi mashers) and replacing them with cheaper versions (lobster bisque to shrimp and lobster bisque).  To be fair this is not a true one star but it is at 170.00 for 2.  Spend your big money elsewhere!\n",

I am only writing this review because not once, but TWICE the sausage in my breakfast sandwiches was undercooked and needed to be thrown out. The first time I chalked it up as a mistake by the cook working too fast but the second time I ordered the sausage \"well done\" and explained my prior experience. I will not be carrying-out from this location again and would advise others picking up large orders to avoid it as well.\n",

We ordered the crab cakes and were very surprised when we got them that there was an added bonus. There was a fly on the lettuce which flew off and into the bread oil when we put our fork into the dish. We told Mark, our faithful waiter, an we got \"new\" crabcakes. My problem is that we were stil charged for them and they did not even bother t buy us a drink. I realize business is good but please, take care of your customers. The Antique Table is now in the penalty box.\n",

We were the only ones there, asked for recommendations, and opted to order take-out. We focused on the \"meat\" dishes. The food all tasted the same -- and not good at that.

This is bad, but not quite as bad as our sneaky-ass waiter asking us in passing, \"would you care for some bread?\"  Well shit dude, we have to ask? Yes, bring us some damn bread, for the love of God.  Wait, you are charging me for it?!  Suddenly I start looking suspiciously at my fork, water, napkin, salt.

This period lasted 40 minutes.  I shit you not.  We were flagging down bussers and randoms.  Begging.  Pleading.  If I had a flare gun I am confident that this guy would have missed it.

I tolerated this place because I live so close, but yesterday was the last straw. He said to another customer, \" and if you get a call, ask if they are Jewish. If they are..charge them more!\" then he said to the same guy..\"you are not Jewish are you?\" I told him I was and this was offensive! He sad he was teasing and not offensive.

Although I cannot say with 100% certainty that this meal was the culprit, I can say that because we had reservations at closing (and I do not understand why they allow this), we were treated as an after thought.  They were clearing tables all around us, and rushing us through the courses.  Ordinarily, this does not really bother me, but in combination with the violent illness, I can definitely see the kitchen staff wanting to get the heck home as soon as possible (again, why do they schedule people at & after closing???).

The gravy had a spice I could not put my finger plus there was no salt on any of the sides. The chicken fell flat, no seasoning and soggy. Maybe it is me that does not get what the fuss is about with this joint. My husband will even eat all the bones if it is good fried chicken but not tonight.  Our discussion during dinner was where we could get better chicken. The results: Popeye's, KFC and Publix although I am sure we could think of some more places.  We had very high hopes since the BBQ at The Smokehouse is really the best BBQ in Orlando but this will go our \"list\" of places to never try again.\n",

The chicken was super dry and tough and just had sauce poured over it. No vegetables nothing just dried out tough chicken and bland sauce. The fried rice was literally just rice no onion, peas, or carrots to make it even look like it was fried rice. The egg roll was good but small.  I have not been back so I am not sure if it was just a bad day but either way the food was definitely underwhelming and I do not think I will take a chance at wasting 10bucks for something that might be better.\n",

As they gave it to us nearly an hour after we order and was leaving..and wanted to scold and argue with us because we could not be patient..

That is I was...until I sat down. We were ignored by the wait staff for about 20 minutes. They made up for it by bringing us complimentary glasses of sparking rose.  There is a fondue dish that is supposed to be amazing on their bar menu-we wanted it as an appetizer, and we were told that the chef does not serve any of the bar menu in the main part of the restaurant....what?

I was excited to see there was one kind of close to where I live because I will avoid McDonald's at all cost but BLEK!!! I will go to Burger King from now on if this is what I have to drink. I Do Not Know what it is about this location but their drinks taste absolutely HORRIBLE. Nothing like the other ones I have visited. Ew.\n",
            "This place used to be so good!   Now it is just awful.  Food is tasteless.  Bums me out- they have taken all the tasty items off the menu.  Tonight was the last straw- I will never be back....\n",
            "I Have heard many wonderful reviews of this bar. However, the bartender was exceedingly rude. He not only failed to provide us with the drinks we ordered, but he also decided that because we complained about the drinks he would kick us out of the bar. He then followed us to a nearby bar and told the bouncer not to let us in. If management is looking to improve their sales, they should look at the attitude of an overweight employee who wears a fedora. We would have happily spent our money on many rounds of drinks and food. I will not be returning.\n",

Every time I ask for the check they give me a scratch piece of paper with a total written on it. Nothing else.  Listen I do not care if you do not have a computer system, I still expect to see a written out tab of what I had, with how much each item was, and the total. Come on that is just common cense.\n",
            "Nice atmosphere but the food is horrible.  I ordered the steak tips which were $18 which I feel is really quite expensive.  I really would not of mind spending $18 on well prepared steak tips but they had no flavor and not worth the price. Service was just ok..nothing special. I will not be going back.  I would recommend going down the street to Cheesecake Factory instead. Do not waste your time here.\n",

Menu changes, so do not choose to go there based on the menu on yelp.  It was not even close.  The food was atrocious.  We had a party of 12 people with almost the entire range of menu ordered and no one enjoyed their meal.  The short rib was actually a steak (and inedible), salads were bad, paid over $25 for 3 scallops, cheese platter had 3 cubes of cheese, Mac and cheese was burnt.  \n",

            "I am only giving one star since I have not tried the food, this review is strictly on hours and maybe viva la vegan will change their hours on ALL of their advertising sites. We were SO excited to try viva la vegan, we are from Birmingham and have been recommended vlv numerous times! So we look them up on Yelp, they close at 9 according to yelp, google and their Facebook page, it is currently 8:25 and I wanted to place an order so I could just pick it up and take it back to our hotel. Well,  no answer after 4 back to back calls, so I of course give up. We decide to rush down to the restaurant, knowing we might get their with a few minutes to spare, but still hopeful! It is 8:40, I walk in the door even though the open sign is off. I ask both employees, one cleaning up and the other at the window if they are still open and they both tell me no. So I ask, \"you are open until 9? That is what it says on your website.\" They tell me that they close their doors at 8:45!  I drove almost 20 minutes and it was not even 9 of the clock.. another family walked in before me and they were refused service as well. You all, I am a little peeved, it is not THAT big of a deal but it totally hurt my feelings, killed my vibe for the restaurant and just really disappointed me. I do get that it was 15 minutes until closing but that was UNTIL closing, you close when you say you close at 9. I am not sure if I can get over this, I was REALLY looking forward to this, our whole family is vegan. So Viva La Vegan, you really should change your hours to closing at 8:45 not 9 because 15 minutes make a HUGE difference.....\n",
            "Horrible! We went on a Saturday night and the bar was loud and busy. Our party of 4 each ordered an entree, the food was bland and my chicken mac and cheese was so tough and dry that I had problems cutting it. The waitress clearly did not know the menu and forgot that my entree and my sons came with a salad, which I never got. The food is nothing to rave about, most of it seemed precooked. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food, we spent almost $60 on a horrible meal and I hope I can help others avoid doing the same.\n",

If the owner is responsible they are just bleeding  the place for every cent they can. DISGUSTING.\n",

Save your time and money and go elsewhere if you are looking to bowl, shoot pool, drink beer, and grab a bite. I have worked in the service industry and always try to cut places slack, and despite that this place was awful. After being told it would be a 45 minute wait to bowl (despite two lanes being empty), an hour and a half later we were finally paged, then told we had to wait at the back of the line to actually then get our lane and shoes. When we finally got to the lane this is what was there waiting for us (see photo). Save your money and go elsewhere that is properly staffed and well-run.\n",
            "Decided to give this place a try, but I will never go there again.  I spent over $30 for a pizza, sub, and bread sticks; the bread sticks were NOT bread sticks but dethawed bread rolls that had cheese melted on top.... My clue to not buy them should have been when the girl on the phone said \"you want what?  Marinara? Uhhh, I can give you spaghetti sauce...\".  The pizza was pretty tasteless and looked like they tried to knock off Donatos.  The veggie sub was ok once I seasoned it at home.  This place is definitely not legitimate Italian and could not survive if it was not in rural Ohio where a lot of people probably do not know any better.\n",

            "\n",
            "At last, I want to talk about their food. The food is definitely not as good as Boiling Crab, but it is actually okay food. I can tell they made really good sauce, but the shrimp/crab/corn were not marinated for enough time so there was not so much \"cajun\" taste out of it. I just came back from New Orleans, so there might be a slight bias from this comment :)\n",

            "I am so sad writing this review. This place has so much potential to be great and it just seems worse and worse each time. I think a lot of the problem may be staffing. The wait time for food is extremely long and it seems like they always have just one person making the food which kind of explains that. But there is never any urgency to get the food out. I went yesterday and my tacos were just sad looking. Lacked flavor and were not very warm. I want this place to stick around but I am not very hopeful at this point.\n",
            "This place sucks. Went midday Saturday, terrible service, poor food. It took 30 min+ to get a side salad, nachos and a cheese pizza. Nachos were a stale brick, pizza flavorless, and how do you screw up a salad?... Stale cornbread croutons. FAIL\n",

I had my backpack with me as well, not as important, but a bag I had had since my time in the Marines, so it had nostalgia to me... So I am at the main bar downstairs most the time, ordering Bud Light drafts from Samantha... eventually a different girl came in and I was ordering the same from her as well... eventually I ventured upstairs, cut up the rug, sang some karaoke, it was an enjoyable evening mostly... I consumed far more beverages than I should have, and eventually I get asked to leave... I was not causing issues, nor was I engaging in any activities that might have been frowned upon by such an establishment, but I made my exit, no questions asked... one of the employees had brought my camera to me from upstairs, I paid my tab, and do not ever recall leaving with my camera and backpack... from the moment I left, to the moment I get woken up (from a Boston Police Sgt and ambulance staff), on a bench in Mckinley Sq, everything is a complete blur, almost as if it did not happen... when I got woken up around 3am, my belongings were nowhere to be found... two things could have happened... one, I could have accidentally left my belongings within the confines of Sissy Ks and some scumbag made off with  them, or two, I had  them with me and some scumbag thief stole  them when I was out of it... So I returned to Sissy Ks at 11:30 Thursday morning, hopeful my items had been found and put aside... unfortunately they had not, and when I spoke with the GM, asking if there is surveillance footage I can review, I was met with \"our cameras do not actually record\"... well that sucks! So what happens if someone else is over-served, eventually leaves and gets hit and killed by a car? well, since there is no record of it I guess it never happened... I am not expecting the bartenders to be babysitting, but they should know to shut someone off if they believe that individual has had too much to drink, perhaps even offer to call an uber or lyft if they feel that person might get hurt (or robbed) from the intoxicated state they are in... what happens if a girl gets sexually assaulted within Sissy Ks? again, I guess it never happened... I plan on filing a police report with the Boston Police the next time I can make it into the city... I am a single dad, a Marine Corps OEF veteran, a Boston native, and some lowlife has the audacity to steal one of the few things I own... I cannot believe what this world is coming to : /\n",

I definitely do not recommend dining here if you are looking for quality chinese food\n",

They would have probably made at least $15 more dollars off of me. When I politely said \"excuse me\" to our waiter 5 minutes ago, he said he would be right back.

So when my friend suggested hitting it up for this year's restaurant week, I was immediately on-board. We made our reservations three weeks in advance - even though 9 pm on a Tuesday was the earliest they could take us. Seemed a bit late, but I figured we would get seated and hopefully finish by 10:30. Not the worst thing. We got dressed up, braved a storm, and made it about 10 minutes before our reservation. \n",

The host was visibly annoyed and did not have an update for her. My friend politely asked if we could have some drink menus. I was already over it at this point. I did not really feel like drinking, I would rather just sit down and eat but that apparently was not possible, even though we had a reservation. He brought us some menus but no one ever came back to take our drink order. So we sat there until 9:50, when one of us finally made the executive decision to leave. I was really glad she did. I had no desire to drop $60 on a meal that starts some time after 10 on a Tuesday night in a place where there was zero customer service. At this point, they did not even have an ETA on when we could be seated. My friend Jen is particularly calm and articulate, so she went to the hostess station to cancel our reservation. A different hostess was up there, and I could see from her body language and facial expression that she was angry with us. Jen calmly asked her to have the manager call the next day, as Jen's number was the one associated with the reservation. She had not heard from the manager by the time this review was written. \n",

That should have been your first cue to send over a round of cocktails, Meritage. Running 50 minutes late? You owe it to your customers to at least address us. Make it seem like you care, even if you do not. Make us feel valued. Just because you have a great rating does not mean you can take your customers for granted. I fully expected to write a 5 star review for this place. Now I doubt I will ever be back.\n",

Then waited another 5 minutes before someone came to the table with more menus and told us that our server would be right with us. Waited another 10 minutes until the waiters came to take our order. He said he did not see us. I ordered a Greek salad, a slice of BBQ pit pizza and my husband ordered a spaghetti with meatballs. My salad and pizza came in a timely manner, but my husband's spaghetti never came. He then told the waiter to give us our check and deduct his order since it never came. The waiter was nice and apologized and came back with his ordered all boxed in so we could take it home and said that he should be able to waive the whole check. Then he came back charging us $7 for my salad. We thought it was cheesy for them to charge us anything after this horrible experience. The pizza was ok, the salad was nothing to brag about, the dressing is just balsamic vinegar with olive oil, and the spaghetti was disgusting. There was no sauce!! Wednesdays seem to be the family night out with all the kids, a trivia night and 1/4 of the regular staff according to the waiter.\n",
            "Did not even get to eat. Sat for ten min. With three servers working the area and no one stopped to lift a finger to take an order. The manager was standing 10 feet away and was oblivious to the fact that I was sitting there. Service rating is 0. Food rating unknown. Stay away!\n",

            "The staff did not help sell the place - indicating they were out of nearly everything (how hard is it to make fish spread?), and kept telling us they would have more tomorrow.  Does this mean I am supposed to come back tomorrow?  The limited menu would limit my desire to come back.  They also did not know how to make peel and eat shrimp - it came covered in sauce with a side of drawn butter, nor did they know how to answer the phone.\n",

It made me feel uncomfortable , so i asked for a different drink and they give a hard time. I drove off and would never come back to this In and Out burger again.\n",
            "Do not come here if they are not answering the phone - they close the kitchen prior to what is listed online and on their door. I got here at 9:30 pm and the door was locked even though there were people inside and the sign was listed as closing at 10.\n",
            "If I could give this place zero stars I would. The hostess are complete morons. Me and my kids walked in and the hostesses told us we had to wait 25 minutes. I said okay, but then after looking around there were empty tables EVERYWHERE. I asked why we could not sit at one of those tables and they said those tables and whole sections were closed. Talk about bad customer service. They need new hostesses.\n",

            "I could not be more disgusted. I went into the restaurant instead of waiting in the 12 car deep drive through assuming I would get better more prompt service. I ordered a few soft tacos and 4 cinnamon delights. As my food was completed, I watched one of the cooks pop something into his mouth upon wrapping up my order. That jerk ate one of my cinnamon delights right in front of my face and I did not realize it until I looked in my bag and there were only 3. Absolutely disgusting and I will never return.\n",
            "I waited ten mins past the time an employee ensured me the restaurant would open.  I gave up and left on an empty stomach to catch my flight.  If I had the extra time, I would have complained to a manger about the inappropriate and offensive rap/hip hop music being played in the background of the restaurant.  Extremely disappointed.\n",

            "I do not even write reviews, but I had a weird experience in here over the weekend. I usually just grab Dunks, but I wanted to try something different, and I found out about this place on Yelp. First off, to be fair, I will say the bagels I got were very tasty. But here is what happened. I went in right before they closed on Sunday. Got a couple of bagels, the guy even hooked me up with a free plain bagel. It was $5 and change. Classic problem unfolds: I give the guy a $20, he gives me change for a $10. I stopped, collected my memory to make sure I was right, and told him I gave him a $20. He initially disagrees: \"You gave me a $10.\" I explain that I only had $20s, and that I would not come in here and try to pull one over on him like that. He goes to give me the $10 he owes me, but literally holds his grip on the bill while he is handing it to me. I said \"You will see when you tally out your registers.\" and he said they would already tallied the register for the day, so that would not help somehow. This is where it got a little weird. He asked me to stay while he checks the security footage, and pulls out his smartphone. I reluctantly agree, because I know I did not do anything wrong. When he cannot pull up the footage, he asks me to leave my number. I actually wrote down my name and my phone number for this guy who is acting like I tried to steal $10 from his company, when it was he who made the mistake in the first place. Not really a good experience. Felt like I was being accused of something I had nothing to do with. I think I will find my tasty bagels elsewhere from now on.\n",

The chimichanga consisted of a fried flour tortilla filled with nothing but incredibly dry hunks of shredded beef--like shoe leather dry. If was, frankly, disgusting. Oh, and all of this cost $14 and change. \n",

They took forever to take the order. Once we were finished eating we had to wait half an hour before anyone came to see if we were all set. Than we told them to bring the check and they did. Than it took them another 20 minutes to come back to take our credit card so we could leave. THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!! What makes it worse is that restaurant was completely empty there was only one other table there... SO I do not understand why this kind of service????\n",

            "As if the food was not completely deplorable, while I was there the \"owner\" spent more time yelling at this poor guy trying to change a flat tire in the parking lot then he did on servicing his customers. It appeared to be a young kid in a suit who popped his tire on the potholed laden roads of Dudley Square. Instead of causing a giant traffic snarl he pulled in the lot and called AAA. For whatever reason the owner thought it would add to this guys already awesome evening by yelling at him to get off his property. (I remind you that this is a parking lot right next to the restaurant, not someone is private driveway). The owner even called the police, but the AAA truck had towed the car by the time they arrived. Needless to say BPD was more than annoyed at this waste of a call.\n",

For the price, it should have at least come with a side.  Half the price would actually be the reasonable price.  The clam chowder was mostly potatoes.  The grilled chicken sandwich was thrown together with a slice of lettuce and white bread.  For such a high traffic location, I would expect the service and quality to be better.  My only positive note is the food was hot.\n",

So as we were rushed out ,  I was thinking he could have seated them at the table for 2 and seat us at corner table where  3 people can sit.

I would have given it a negative couple of stars, but that was not an option.\n",

Really to cook shrimp takes seconds. Over charged for a plate of shrimp, 10 shrimp with garlic and chillies is $20.  Over salted shrimp! Used a groupon and charged extra $5 for processing fee, tried to take bill and the waiter took bill.  Called Groupon and reported them and got my money back.. Called to speak to Manager and told the charge was for alcohol, we never had alcohol we had tea and water.. Also wanted to charge us for using debit, a $5 charge for debit transactions under $50.  Never go to this restaurant, shady business and shady employees. Food is not good and no customer satisfaction.\n",

I thought it was just the smell.  Without apologizing, he gave me another glass of a different red wine which was equally horrid but probably opened within the last 48 hours, so that was a plus.  He asked me if I liked it, of course I told the truth (that I did not, in a nice way).  He threw it out, told me that I did not want wine that night and would not serve me.  Guess I was not going to drink that after all?  Can I order something else without you taking it away?  Never been to a place where it is so difficult to buy booze.\n",

Turns out they had a charge for getting green tea that they did not mention even though tea was part of the meal price. . I asked for a refund and was told by the manager/owner that the cashier would pay me out of her own money! Turned out the cashier had no money and the owner continued to argue with me. I have never had an encounter in a restaurant like this one.  The owner was a mean, nasty, rude person who was willing to mistreat her employee and her customer.  I cannot recommend anything about this lace. Stay away from it.\n",

We were a group if 7 and we waited for a table which I understood but then after getting seated it took 20 minutes to get drinks, the 2 shakes that where order took almost 45 minutes to get. Then after an 1 hour I question the server a few times and the manager to see when the food would be out. Finally they bring the food out and it is cold. The only chicken sandwich that was order was made incorrectly. We sent back the chicken sandwich because the stuff that was asked to be removed was due to food allergies. They take it back switch the bread and bring it right back out still with the seeds and juice from the tomatoes all over the check and mayo still on the lettuce. By this time the rest of the group had finished eating so we said forget. They bring out the bill the chicken sandwich is still on it. So the manager tells me after being their for almost 1 1/2 hours will I guess I can remove the chicken sandwich since you did not get it. I called Corp sitting in the location was advised that I would receive a all back in 2bus days here we are 2 weeks later and still no word. Shows how much the company or store cares.\n",

I started my stop watch on my phone once I noticed that the line was not moving. The reason was that the workers seemed very new and the only thing that they were working on was call in orders. Every time a guest would get to the spot to order what they wanted to worker would say we will be right with you and them make 2 phone orders. This is just very inefficient.

I am quite passionate about my noodle soups and this, by far, has been the most inedible noodle soup I have ever eaten (well, tried to eat).  The ingredients I mentioned above were alright in there own sense, but what made the dish inedible was the soup itself.  The soup had a taste unlike any other.  I am still undecided whether it tasted like the chef forgot what he was cooking or used the soup to wash his feet before serving it.  Anyone that has experienced authentic Asian noodle soup will know that you drink the soup after eating the rest of the contents.  In the beginning, having just received the bowl of noodles, I happily brought up a decent sized clump of noodles and began to slurp it up, then the taste hit me like a bullet train. At that moment, the very idea of drinking that soup was thrown out the window and down into the storm drains to rot forever.  If that does not tell you how my experience went...

            "It pains me to write this review as the restaurant has many fond memories for me; I first discovered The Clay Pit in 1999 when I moved to Austin, and my wife and I frequently went to the restaurant when we were dating. Being Indian and the son of an amazing cook, my standards for Indian food are quite high. And until recently (I would say the last year or so), The Clay Pit has always lived up to those standards. However, last week I went with my family to celebrate my birthday, and except for the service which was friendly and attentive, everything else fell short. On the cleanliness front, my wife complained of a very messy bathroom that stank of raw sewage, and the table and chairs were covered with a stickiness that required a major scrub down to get clean. Our food was subpar as well. We ordered the vegetable pakora and tandoori vegetables as appetizers. The pakora were over-breaded and cold, the tandoori vegetables consisted mainly of onions and overcooked broccoli. For entrees, we had a rice puloa in which the rice was severely overcooked (mushy to the touch), a malai kofta where the kofta were incredibly dry and dense, and a saag paneer where the saag was clearly old as it was an oxidized dark green / brownish color -- incredibly unappetizing for cooked spinach! The long and the short of the food is that 3 members of our dining party suffered from stomach illness after the dinner!! Sadly, this experience was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, and my family will not be returning to the restaurant. The Clay Pit must maintain higher standards of cleanliness and freshness!\n",

I am sorry I do not want store credit. I do not want to eat anything else from there ever again! Oh and they also argued with me about how it was not their fault they forgot the sauce.

Terrible mistake. I placed my order, somebody brought it out, placed in on the table next to us, and did not tell us for 20 MINUTES. A black waiter had to come by and give it to us and even SHE was confused why they ignored us and did not give us our order. So of course our food was cold by then. Will not be going there again.

I went there last week, sat near the bar...the owner of the restaurant was training an employee to prepare food. At first I did not know it was food actually, there were pink pasty thing in clear plastic bags. They were poking holes into the bags with kabob sticks. After my lunch I was paying my bill...I asked the employee what they were and what are they for? She told me that they were mechanically separated meat and they were bag so they can be steamed. That is right! Mechanically separated meat to be cooked in plastic bags! They poked holes to prevent them from exploding. FULL ON CANCER ALERT!!!! I told her that was not a safe way to prepare food. She replied back in a thick Chinese or korean accent...\"I know, Vietnamese people do not care about cancer\" what the heck? I am Vietnamese and I care about cancer and so a lot of Vietnamese people out there.  I think what she meant was THE Vietnamese owner does not care about this issue.

Clearly, we expected it to be busy since it was Friday.... but to our surprise, despite there being a major line - there were more empty tables than sat tables. The host told us that their evening shift wait staff was not in yet, and so they could not seat everyone and that it was a 30 minute wait. WHO DOES NOT SCHEDULE WAIT STAFF AT RUSH HOUR ON FRIDAY? Unbelievable. We snagged a first come first serve table at the bar and ordered there. After a ridiculously long wait, our food finally came out. Both mine and my fathers steaks were cold. Not luke warm, cold... like they had been sitting there for awhile. Just then our favorite waitress walked by and stopped to say hello. It was now about 7:30 and she was just coming on. She even commented on how if they would have just called her, she would have come in early. Neither my father nor I ate our steaks; and finally called it quits.

            "So I made my reservation for my birthday dinner on January 14th at 8:30 pm for a party of 17 people. When we all arrived at 8:30 pm we were not seated due to the fact that our table was not ready and they were apparently over booked so we waited. 20 minutes go by and still no table. There is a couple of people waiting for a small table and they were given complimentary flat bread while my party and I were not given anything until one of my friend's asked the hostess for some bread since the other group received some and we had been there for over 30 minutes waiting. They also gave out some wine to a few of my guests. So we continue to wait in the lobby and it is 9:30 pm and the manager says he will seat us shortly so I was annoyed because all of my guests were hungry at this point and standing around in the lobby and at the bar trying to get drinks since the wait was ridiculous. The manager says he will give us a complimentary bottle at the table and some more flat bread. So we are finally seated at 9:40 pm even though my reservation was for 8:30 pm! I made a reservation for a party of 17, but our table only seated 13 people! So after all of the waiting, my boyfriend and three of my friends have to sit at a separate table behind the rest of the group for another 30 minutes until they were able to get another table to seat us together. The manager never brings the complimentary bottle and then comes to the table with an almost empty bottle of wine saying \"this is the complimentary bottle that I gave to the group in the lobby\" and I told him that I did not even receive a glass and neither did some of my guests and how am I supposed to know where this almost empty bottle with no top came from. So he left the bottle on the table and I tell the awesome waiter named Max our issue and he gets us a brand new bottle. I felt extremely annoyed that the manager was being so rude by leaving a practically empty bottle of wine on the table and stating that this is the one he offered to us when I never even received a glass. I know that if a majority of my party were 10 shades lighter aka if we were white men then this terrible service after an hour and 15 minute wait would never had happened. I will not recommend this location to anyone for a birthday dinner because my guests and I were not treated well at all by management. I will say that our food was good and so was the server Max who worked hard to make the situation better unlike the manager who never came back to the table to see if everything was going well.\n",

Went in around 1pm on a tuesday, based upon reviews, thought place was going to be packed, not one single table with paying customers, just 2 employees sitting at one of the multiple tables in the back partvof the restaurant, and 2 other people arranging tables and walking back and forth. Finally, after 5 minutes, the greedy server came around to take our drink order, some of us order iced water, some coke, and sprite, and my son order a lemonade, which after 3 minutes, she told us they where out of.  She offered him either a coke or sprite, which he rejected, and asked instead for a glass with iced water.  After 5 minutes, SURPRISE, he had a lemonade on the table, or at least looked as one, but no it was a flavorless glass of water with lots of sugar in it. Now, going to the food, dumplings were delicious, eggroll tasted like frozen food boxed one, sweet and sour pork was crappy, crispy beef was great, walnut shrimp was ok, about a B+, chowmein and fried rice were lousy, flavorless and warm, not hot as they should.  When the check came, I do not understand why they impose you a 18-20% tip already included on your bill.  I do not know if you agree with me, but why should you tip that much for service that was bad, and when the server does not do a good job according to your expectations and in turn tries to push items that increase your check, so that she can pump up her 20% tip that she did not deserve.  Tips are deserved with the quality of your service: terrible service = no tip, bad service = no more than 10%, ok service = upto 15%, great service = 18% up to no limit.  Again, tips are worked for, not imposed.  \n",

Very very disrespectful, no manager around to fix the situation and the only thing that was said is, \" we will sit you down when the next table come up\" I will not be going back #theysaysupportblackbusiness\n",
            "I will be honest, I love diners and it is my favorite place to eat. The first and last time I came here I sat at the bar stools and the waitresses were very nice. I Have seen alot of unclean places but when I saw 3 baby roaches crawling on the counter top that was a little too much for me. I just cannot bring myself to ever go back there. I wish the place well but they have to get cleaner there. In my case first impressions are ever lasting.\n",
            "I am very disappointed in the staff at Smokey Bones! My friend and I came in last night to have some steaks and a drinks to relax at the bar and I have to say it was the WORST service that I have ever had! The kitchen is very close to the bar and I could hear everything that the waitresses and bartenders were talking about. The staff was arguing amongst each other! The red head bartender was yelling at a waiter threatening to quit and stormed out dramatically. I could not believe they were acting this way in front of customers. Also my food took extremely long and was not cooked correctly. I will most definitely will not be back to this location again! Shame on you Smokey Bones!\n",
            "Poor rating because I walkd up to one of my fave lunch spots in Tanasbourne and it was closed for business.  Must have happened this week, since I swear I was just there last week...  Sad....another one bites the dust.\n",

He high fives some friends that come in, they go outside for a smoke and light up while the door's still open, so naturally the place starts to reak of smoke. \n",

            "3 tables sit empty in the tiny restaurant... um, one should be ours, right? We have been here for at least 30 minutes at this point. Nope. Those tables are for the friends of the host. And the others? For a couple of walk-ins. \n",
            "\n",
            "Ok, cool. They just clearly lied to us in the beginning and proceeded to ignore us the whole night. I honestly think they had no intention of serving us.

I explained that I saw walk-ins getting tables after us, and, like akin to a child getting caught covered in chocolate sauce, his response was \"No, No, I did not seat people that came in after.\" Either this guy is delusional, or just has the mentality of a 4 year old. \n",
            "\n",
            "In sum- the unprofessionalism of this restaurant is literally unparalelled. And who wants to go to a restaurant and be talked down to? Especially when the place smells of smoke, and the prices are $15 for a roll.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot advise on how the food is, but I can advise that you probably do not want to go here due to the sheer (for lack of a better word) douchebaggery of the employees. After all, do you want your money to go to restaurant with hard-working, kind, hospitable employees, or do you want it to go to obvlivious, careless individuals who clearly do not care whether you are there or not? \n",

Every table around us has been waiting as long as we have. It took an hour just to get our appetizer. We switched tables because the air vent was freezing cold on us and the waitress told us it would not be a problem. Well since they had someone else deliver our food, the Stromboli that we ordered was delivered to our original table so a new one has to be cooked. The couple across from us got fed up and left after waiting too long to get any food. I am extremely disappointed in the service here.\n",
            "I got really sick after eating here on Good Friday. We had eaten here a couple of times prior. It is always very underwhelming, but we have friends that like it. The service is usually slow, portions are small, and food lacks flavor. We will never go back after the most recent experience though.\n",
            "What a waste of a great spot. The bar downstairs is pretty cool but the outside patio is the pits. The food is pricey and not worth it. If you want a place to go to get a beer and people watch this is the place other than that keep movin and you would not be disappointed\n",
            "Went in tonight around 7pm, Was so excited to try this place, the hostess was so sweet and told us we would like it when we told her we were from Los Angeles, sat on the patio, not busy since only 1 other table was out there. Waitress, I think Vanessa came out to the patio to check on the other table that was right next to us THREE times  and we sat there with our menus closed waiting for her to come over to us. Nothing. Great atmosphere, looked like great food, shitty waitress, get rid of her and that nasty look on her face.\n",
            "Came by today and it was closed. Hope she goes out of business because she is bad for the other black businesses in the community. All she does is try and get other black businesses in the area closed instead of capitalizing off of it.  She is a low down evil miserable individual.\n",
            "Disappointing...I ordered the Il Mondo pizza for delivery. It was 20 min late (granted it is a Friday evening) and cooler than lukewarm. Even after warming it up in the oven, the pizza had absolutely no flavor.  Hate to waste food but I threw the entire thing in the dumpster. Oh well, I took a chance on a new place for pizza, first time, last time...\n",
            "This place is for amateurs. The meat and cheese selection was a joke. The filet was not a real filet; it had to be a faux filet. The cooks do not know what medium means because it was raw in the center. The potatoes were undercooked.  The servers lacked confidence. The service was slow. I do not get why this place has good reviews.\n",
            "I have to say - I typically love this place. My friends come in generally once a week for a late morning/ early afternoon brunch. Food and service are generally awesome. Even with a wait.\n",

            "Place looked great but losing a reservation for a group of 15 people is pretty bad. Just some poor management, organization and communication on their part as we had confirmation of the reservation. Worse that they were not even willing to accommodate us with any extra effort to seat us quickly or some drinks if we decided to wait.\n",
            "I am shocked to see good reviews of this place.... the food was so bad we just left it there. Salsa tastes like ketchup/spaghettios. Burrito was bland, Mole sauce was gross. \n",

I decided I would not make a fuss about it and plugged in my phone at a nearby socket so that I could see the score of the game.  My phone was dead and there was no one else in this corner of the restaurant.  I got up several times to check the score.  In about 15 minutes I got up to get some more popcorn and saw that if I moved back a row I could see the game better, so I moved.  It was then that the owner came over and unplugged my phone and started to take it away.  I told him that it was my phone and he threw it on my table and told me that it was rude of me to take up three tables and plug my phone in.  I did not say anything and he left.\n",
            "      He came back in about 15 minutes  and proceeded to tell me how rude I was.  Perplexed, I calmly told him that he was the one who was rude then I got up to go pay my bill and leave.  He followed me and said that I had spilled some popcorn on the floor and wanted me to go pick it up.  I said I was leaving and left.  He went back and picked up some popcorn and followed me out to my car and tried to throw the popcorn in my car.  If you think a guy like that deserves to get your money  then  go ahead but I do not and will never go back there.\n",

When you call a restaurant a week in advance for dinner reservations at 7:30 you expect to get in the fucking restaurant. apparently all it takes is one moronic hostess and place to forget entirely you made reservations.

I paid $45 for a vegetable plate, mystery meat (oh that was chicken) over rice. My seventy six year old aunt said \"that she wanted to go to S&S Cafeteria but I said Busy Bee would be better\". What a tongue lashing I got from her. Salty collards, half cooked yams and a tablespoon of Broccoli Rice Casserole.  We had a to go order.  I should have listened to my elder and went to the cafeteria.\n",

An hour later I called and asked where the food was. I was told the driver left 20 minutes ago and should be right there. 15 minutes later I called back and was told again the driver would be there any second. 15 minutes later after that I called and cancelled my order. It was 9:00. The person on the phone said, \"You know she is going to be there any second right?\" Well considering she had my food in the car for well over an hour it is probably cold. The food is expensive enough. I do not want soggy fries and cold pizza. Next time I will stick to someone who actually delivers.\n",
            "I was very excited to try this place after hearing they were voted the best nachos in Portland. But, by the end of the night I was very disappointed. The service was slow, the food was mediocre, and the drinks were bland. I had their \"specialty\" drink, the cucumber mule, and I think it was just cucumber water with a pinch of vodka. It took our server over a hour to let me know that they were out of the Papas Bravas. I had also ordered a small nacho, which she forgot and tried to make up for it by bringing me a large, which was basically just two pounds of cheese and a handful of chips. Needless to say, I was not impressed with the \"best\" nachos in  Portland and do not anticipate going back to the Conquistador anytime soon.\n",

First of all, being from LA, I did not expect much knowing that Austin does not have as huge an asian culture as LA. However, from everywhere else, I expected portions to be \"bigger\" like the Texan way. I was sadly mistaken. It cost at least 30 dollars a person. Presentation was horrible. The chef barely did anything cool. The one thing he did do was the volcano which has been done hundreds of times. The quality of the food was subpar, Ill go back to LA for Benihana\n",

After overselling and leaving many (prepaid) patrons out in the cold, we were told that we could have entry to another party a few miles away.  Since we were clearly not getting in before midnight, we reluctantly left our (paid) parking spot and headed out to see if we could be somewhere other than outside.

A couple of us had salads with our entrees and that was probably the highlight of our the entrees.  When the bruschetta was brought to us I would have sworn it was served on pumpernickel bread, that is how burnt the bread was.  My daughter took it back and asked if it could be less toasted.  The second serving was a little better but still overtoasted.  The fettuccine alfredo with shrimp was overcooked and the shrimp dry.  The pollo alla griglia was horrible, the grilled vegetables were charred (not grilled) and cold, the chicken was so overcooked that it was dry and hard and lukewarm.  The pizza crust was burnt and my guest just ate the toppings.  As we were half way through our meals the bread showed up.  Now that I think of it, that was the only thing besides the fried mozzarella that really was worth eating and the money spent.  My son in law had asked that we order something to go and bring home.  He had wanted the pollo alla griglia and after I sent him a picture of my entrée he said he would pass and ask we just bring him something from Whataburger.\n",

We then ordered dessert. Again reminded them of the deathly allergy and asked if they would be ok having the chocolate cake. He again went back to the kitchen and asked. Once cleared he came back and said it is safe, No nuts are in the chocolate cake or ice cream that comes with it. So it then came to the table and my son noticed right away there were nuts under the ice cream. So we pulled the dish away from him to check it out. Sure enough there were and not only in his but in everyone is at the table. So we called it to their attention and the woman in charge of the desserts came out and told us \"well there are no nuts in the main ingredients but they are just under the ice cream\".

            "Stopped in here for food, it was disgusting I ordered the chicken with broccoli and the server was incredibly rude because I asked if substituting white rice for pork fried rice was a possibility and she raised her voice at me and said \"No we do not do that here!\" After bringing out the food the chicken tasted so old and gross. (It is just chicken and broccoli how could you possibly mess that up.) My friends ordered the same thing and were so grossed out they returned their plate for the chicken wings. When they brought out the food the plates were dirty so my friends ate on napkins instead. The chicken wings were the size of my thumb. Definitely tasted a little better though. Horrible service. Horrible food.\n",
            "My husband and I have been going there for about two years. The food has been what has kept us coming for the most part. The service has been spotty. . . if we get served by the female gal we get good service but if we get served by the husky male the service is guaranteed to suck. \n",

            "Today my husband and I went in for breakfast. We were served by the husky male. I asked that my poached eggs lean more towards the cooked side. The eggs came and they were practically raw. My husband ordered the scallop mushroom omelet and the eggs were very runny and the scallops were more on the raw side too. Special requests to cook eggs a bit more on the well done side will go completely ignored. \n",

            "The server was short, rude and slapped our check on the table and never even offered to refill my cup of coffee! My husband asked for cream and before he could even finish talking the server said \"Yeah, I got it\" and ten minutes came and went and he never brought the cream. \n",

I decided to give it another go today and I realized I should have taken my first experience as the status quo.  The service was, again, terrible.  Staff is clearly uninterested in customer service or working at all.  The food I wrap I ordered was cold and hard after the falafel I order had been warmed up in the microwave.  It clearly had been sitting in there for hours.  Most of their food seems to contain four cheap ingredients.  When I asked for another ingredient I was charged another dollar, which was fine, but when the employee barely out the addition I added to the wrap and I politely asked for more to be put on I was met with distasteful look.   \n",

When we were finally seated, we were seated in the bar next to a group of obnoxious hipsters who were loudly making fun of everyone.  We had to order out drinks and our meal twice due to incompetent waitstaff.  The food is average seasons 52 food, but I suggest going to another location.  If you are in this area I suggest another restaurant.\n",
            "Do not eat here!  My chicken came out raw! and bloody.  I brought it back and they did give me another plate, it was not red but it still made me sick!  In the bathroom all night.

            "Once we had our food things did not get better. One of the staff members was standing at the pass-through window chatting with kitchen staff and blasting music from her cellphone.

While deciding what to get, the same staff member who was blasting the cellphone music (she is also the employee who took our order originally), jumped right in line in front of her to order a meal herself. Except she did not know what she wanted...so she stood there - forever- chatting with the cashier and saying \"oh, i do not know what I want.\"  Needless to say, my wife never got that muffin.\n",

BOY WAS I WRONG! first off I waited for my food for an hour so I called wondering what was taking so long, they told me they would bring it out and it was done. They brought me the wrong food and then to tell me they gave someone else our food by mistake. Waited around for another 30 minutes to finally get the food. I got home (live 5 mins from AppleBees) and It was cold, not even a little warm, but cold. Once I was finally ready to eat after waiting for about 2 hours for my food, I went to take a bite and out comes a long string of hair. At this point I am completely and utterly disgusted, but still starving. So I decided to search through my food to make sure there was nothing else and what do I find ? Another long ass piece of hair! I would really appreciate a refund.. I Am so disgusted I will never eat here again and make sure to share this information with others\n",

            "I have lived in Newton for 6 years now, and have ordered from this location a number of times. Sometimes they are on point, other times, not so much at all. I give this place one star, not for the food, but for the horrible service. I have given them TOO MANY chances because I love Papa Gino's food, and this is the ONLY location to deliver in my area of Newton. There was one time I ordered from them an hour and ten minutes before closing, so I would have been one of, if not their last delivery, well, they never showed up. My most recent order after a very long time of NOT ordering from them, occurred this past week  on Patriots Day. The order taker over the phone was going to deliver the pizza himself, he told me, after I told him where I was in Chestnut Hill and he did not know where it was, so I had to get real specific of where I was. After waiting a considerable amount of time, the order gets here....WRONG PIZZA! (Again, after a few unforgetting mess ups over the years from this particular location). So I call them up to tell them this, and I get told 'You can get a credit for free food...NEXT TIME'. NO!! NO NEXT TIME!! I want the CORRECT food I ordered TODAY, even if there is an understandable wait. I asked 'Can you send me another pizza?' I am told 'he was the only driver' and obviously he had not gotten back to the store yet, so I asked for a refund and she said 'OK'. What I would have done, is instead of the 'free food credit next time' idea, I would have given the customer an immediate no questions asked refund while remaking a new pizza and have the driver immediately go back out and redeliver the pizza to me upon coming back to the store. THIS is what you SHOULD do if you run a pizza business and COMPLETELY mess an order up. Mistakes happen, we are human, but as I said this particular location has made different types of mistakes quite a few times with me over the years in between getting it right, and upon occasional in store pick up orders, the workers seem to not be to motivated or take it too serious. It really shows. It is also, as I write this, taken quite a few days for the money to go back into my account. The Papa Ginos processing system is WAY too slow, so I have to ONCE AGAIN call the bank today to see if it FINALLY OFFICIALLY went back into my account. This place really is hit or miss. They lost a loyal customer.\n",
            "CalaBar was my go to place for quite some time. The first time my husband and I went, about 2 years ago, we went at night and everything was amazing. They had a live band, service was great, food was delicious. I told many people how awesome it was and it is a black owned business. The next few times that I ate there, I would get turkey burgers as a to go order. The turkey burgers are AMAZING. One day, I decided to stroll in on a quiet afternoon. I ordered a shrimp appetizer that was in a broth. I was warned that it would be spicy, but I was not informed that it would taste like I am licking a piece of salt lick. The shrimp was soooooooo salty. Since it came with broth, I was expecting bread on the side. It would help with the saltiness too. I asked the server for bread and the server told me it would be $2.50 extra. I told the server the broth was extremely salty and I cannot eat this, especially with no bread. The server gave me the bread for free, rightfully so. The shrimp appetizer was very tasty, but the salt numbed my taste buds. I later called the manager, Keri, and she said the cook was new and she apologized and said she would take care of me the next time I came. This was 4.9.15. I know because I saved her info in my phone. The next time I tried Cala was this April, coincidentally. I called in a to go order and I did not mention anything about Keri because it was so long ago. My husband went to pick up the food about 20 minutes after I called. Once he was there, they told him they were out of turkey burgers. At that point, they called me to tell me the same thing. Did it really take 20 minutes to see you did not have what I ordered? My husband decided to order a chicken entree instead and said after waiting for another 15 minutes for the bartender to take his payment, he decided to leave. They will need get our money again. Shame because the food is good when it is not tasting like saltwater and when it is actually available\n",

            "Finally got the chance to come in here today and I have to say the experience was really disappointing. We decided not to go for the AYCE and just order 3 rolls. Everyone around us who did order AYCE got plate after plate after plate while we sat for over 30 minutes waiting. I kept my eye on the sushi bar where 3 rolls had been sitting there waiting to be brought out for well over 15 minutes. Our waitress comes to us to ask what we ordered and we gave her the order again. Sure enough, those rolls that had been sitting there were ours. It was not even that busy. The sushi was so-so. Just really sad. At least we got free Mochi out of it.\n",

            "No! Oooooo no. Where do I begin? A quiet little diner open 24 hours with pie? Sign me up! Big mistake! This place is awful. The food was the worst I have ever had, ever. I got the nachos thinking nobody can mess that up, but I was wrong. Wet stale chip wrong. My husband got the steak with toast and hash browns and that was equally inedible. I just do not see how anyone could like this place. The only redeeming quality was the friendly service.\n",
            "We have gone here every year for the last 6 years.  Tonight we went and had the worst food and service. We were seated in the bar area, the waiter got our drink order a and came back with our drinks, we then had to ask for chips and salsa. Once we got it, we had no salt so I asked a server for salt, 5 minutes later still no salt. I went to the hostess and asked her finally for salt. Then the waiter came back  with the salt and took our order. My husbands meal was wrong and when when tries to ask about it they said  this is what it is.. we then had to ask for silverware and wait on that. My meal was bland, the beans had no flavor. My husband could not get a refill on his drink so he went to the bar himself.  Never again Which is sad. They have become a trendy place and lousy Mexican food.\n",
            "I recommend going there and telling them you hear great things about their $9 Sprite. You may have to use their brand name, \"vodka tonic,\" but you will quickly see that what you get is their signature lemony-flavored soda, with no discernable vodka in it. They sure do know how to enjoy a good joke at the customer's expense. Fun for all.\n",
            "Stopped at the truck during the Trail of Lights. I got the Waylon & Willie .. Husband got aborning Mac. Both were not fresh. Was passed he sandwich immediately upon ordering. Bread was stale, filling had been sitting in the sandwich and it was a soggy, stale & tasteless mess. Spent over  $20 for that. I think I was most disappointed in the fact that Austin is known for food trucks and this was my first experience that was wasted on something disgusting.\n",
            "Came here thinking it was good food after seeing so many good reviews.  Did not come close to how good Thai food should be.

            "This place is down the street from me, and is really convenient to grab breakfast from. However, if you are in a rush, forget it. Expect to be there for an hour for just coffee and an omelet. It takes forever. I had gone her numerous times. My last experience here convinced me to never go there ever again. I had ordered a beacon, egg and cheese on a bagel. After eating about half of it, I found a nice little black hair in the bagel. At this point, my boyfriend had already payed the bill! I was furious and disgusted. He told the girl waitress and she refunded us the 5 $. After having always waited forever to get my food and then finding that hair, I renamed the place, \"Theo's hairy corner!\"  I will never go back!\n",
            "I am sure the food here is good, but I do not know because although I was here for an hour, seated for about 45 min, the server only managed to get our drink orders. I had a plum wine, my husband had a beer, and my three (very hungry, tired) kids had soft drinks. That was $30. And after I requested a check for those drinks, and made it clear that we were leaving due to the poor service, they did not so much as offer to take care of the soft drinks for us. I am here for my sisters wedding, so I would not likely be back anyways, but I was very disappointed in such expensive, poor service.\n",
            "This place has the worst service ever. We ordered food on Sunday evening and they took an hour and a half to deliver it, way past the estimated delivery time. We live 10 minutes away if you walk. We had to call back thrice even to find out what had happened. They kept promising to call back and did not bother.There was no apology, nothing. Really bad customer service.\n",

I will probably never come to this location again.\n",
            "Everything I had here was bad. I got a harvest omelette with potatoes. The eggs were rubbery, the cheese in the omelette was cold, the squash in it was burnt, the whole omelette together was underseasoned and bland. The potatoes were equally underseasoned and bland, lukewarm and had a grainy texture of being parboiled too far ahead of time or something. I got a chai latte that did not taste like much more than water. Could not finish my meal. Would never go back or recommend to anyone.\n",
            "For the 3rd time at Black Bear Diner they have seated people ahead of me. I waited 30 mins for a seat and 4 parties... 2-3 people in each seated ahead of me.

I had to drink water to force the food down, which means it was not cooked fresh but had been sitting at room temperature for more than 2 hours.  After 2 hours, bacteria grows on food rapidly.  The food was not hot or warm, which proves it was spoiled.  I am going to complain on the company website.\n",

I am from New York so I know what authentic Mexican food taste like , expected good tacos due to the name of the place but disappointed , tasted like something whipped up with grocery store tortillas and generic cheese .  Taco Bell taste better to be 100 % honest and you have to make really shitty food to get out beaten by Taco Bell .   I usually do not complain, will just pay never going back but my friend told the server about it and got the manager .  She made it seem as if I was trying to skip out of not paying for the food , most of the food was on the plate and I am an RIGHT NOW I can pay for the meal without a problem .  Overall shitty experience , if you want good food this is not the place to go.\n",
            "This is the noisiest restaurant I have ever dined in, and that is saying some. I went on a Friday night with three friends, and it was pure pandemonium. While the food was OK, it was not memorable and not worth the price. What I will always remember is that we had to shout at each other, even leaning in close to each other's ears to shout, and still we could barely hear each other over the din of the bar, the kitchen, and other diners. The tables are too close together and they really need some kind of sound absorbing ceiling tiles or something. We were all relieved to get out of there and to be able to hear again. We will not go back.\n",

Well lately the customer service has been nothing but rude and the last 2 times I went I asked for a pumpkin iced coffee and they did not put the pumpkin in. The 1st time I told them that and they gave me a replacement and still did not put the pumpkin in it! Last time I went they were not taking credit cards so I asked if I can still use my app and she responded with \"that is what I meant when I said Dunkin' Donuts card!\" Like really?? And that was the 2nd time I did not get pumpkin in the coffee. Will never go here again. Going to the one by UCF now. Fresh coffee and good customer service.\n",

I got fed up and complained to the manager who did not seem to give a damn either.   the other most recent time was the same scenario.

My boyfriend's burrito had no meat when I paid for a chicken burrito and my bowl was missing things I asked for, especially since I ordered double steak and barely got one serving of it.

We do not care for buffets and do not mind paying for good food. Our chicken pieces in the briyani were tasteless. The rice was not as aromatic but still has some golden raisins and cashew nuts like the way we know it. I make better briyani from the premixes that I buy from Indian grocer. The beef pieces in our vindaloo were mostly tasteless and tough.  The curry lacked the vinegary zing - the essence of vindaloo. The basmati rice for the vindaloo also lacked the wonderful aroma like before. Does not surprise me if their star cook has left the building. Should have suspected something amiss when we walked in. The place was all spruced up though the lady at the cashier is still the same. I told her we were regulars and she assured me the food is still good... So disappointing. This time the general concensus on this place is inaccurate. Most likely catering to the tourists crowd.\n",

They have a bunch of \"recommended\" items on the menu that we made the mistake of ordering. We had fried duck (came cold and dry), beef (we had to throw it away, funny, suspicious flavor), cucumber salad (open a kraft honey mustard dressing and pour it in shredded soggy vegetables, yuck), pad Thai (greasy and bland), and summer mango rolls (came apart immediately). \n",

I sipped a glass of white sangria for about an hour as friends I invited were arriving. I enthusiastically hugged them all as they arrived. After some time a group of us ordered more drinks. Mine never came, no biggie, I reordered. The bartended seemed to have misheard my vodka soda order and repeated it as just soda water. I restated \"vodka soda\" and she actually revealed she was cutting me off.... \"huh?\" She had only served me one drink. Now I am embarrassed and angry because I have to explain that I am not drunk at all off the one glass of sangria I got.  Her and some other man were now involved and I was angry so I am breathing heavily and this other bartender man is saying, aloud \"she is angry look she is breathing heavily\" .... honestly this was a happy night that turned into tears and anger because servers went out of their way to make me feel bad about myself? I am still in disbelief thinking about it. My friends swooped in to intervene, not sure if that was for better or for worse but we all ended up leaving pretty abruptly. I will never go back here. Despite having a great experience in November and being treated well by Andrea and Jimmy I just can not forget how poorly I was treated by the other 2 bartenders and the managers there. We moved our large party to Kings and the night was most definitely saved!\n",

After receiving confirmation my husband got a second phone call and everything changed... No Disney tickets, talk about disappointment. To make matters worse, we have been completely disregarded by the customer service agents. I was \"helped\" by a very rude young lady (Jessica) yesterday evening.

Both times ordering something with lobster and crab where culinary skills can not be judged because it is just boiling things. They did provide freshest catch both times. So no regret on that. However extremely pricey. I paid $75 for lobster and crab platter (called \"Venus\" platter)!! If I compare that to Lobster Shack in Protland, ME (another media spot), a similar lobster dinner plate (less the crab) costs around $25 where they also provides the freshest catch. This place is clearly out-of-their-mind overpriced. One of my friends ordered a grilled salmon - and boy that was awful, really! no seasoning, no flavor; the fish was dried up completely. I have never seen anybody screwing up grilling salmon so badly, not even complete amateurs. These guys should not be calling themselves a seafood restaurant if they can not grill salmon! I have been on a culinary journey in Americas for last several years and have fairly good idea for quality delivered per unit price. So needless to say that  second visit to this restaurant was my last visit even though I live close to Boston.\n",

He asked for a second form of ID. I handed him my bank card which has my first, middle, last name. He looked at my bank card, my license, me, my license, me... now I am getting frustrated. He asks me for a THIRD form of ID, but all I have left on me is my cash, because I usually do not pack all of my life's documents when I go out to get drunk.

I eventually ordered Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich and a Coke, while my lady friend ordered the Zuni Roll (without bacon) and a Coke. The first thing we loved about our sandwiches was the bread. It was very fresh, different, and delicious. There, however, was not a second thing we loved about our sandwiches. It ended with the bread. I found mine to be very plain, basically just a baked chicken sandwich. My girl could not find the vegetables on her sandwich, although the menu description promised there would be some. The service was good as we were asked if we wanted refills on our Cokes three times, even though our glasses were still half full. I did remark that the Coca-Cola tasted like ass. It was not syrupy enough, no sweetness at all. We finally finished our sandwiches but we did not want to leave so we each asked for another Coke. They  smiled and salivated, although at the time we did not know why. Then we got THE BILL. $10.00 for 4 Cokes! WTF! OMG! Are they serious? They charge $2.50 per crappy Coke. I was/am still flabbergasted. I cannot even mention the word Coke to my counterpart as she hits me when I do. So after the bill and tip, our \"cheap\" sandwich date costs us a whopping $38.00. Unacceptable. I feel that they should warn us unassuming consumers that they are about to rip us off with expensive mediocre liquid confection before they fetch our beverages. I guarantee I will be passing a 2 liter over the patio fence next time, if there is a next time, which there will not be. And oh by the way, about twenty minutes later, I lost my sandwich in The North Face bathroom. The End.\n",

I received my dish with about 25 pieces of shrimp. That is a hefty portion of shrimp, so if you are into that, order a dish with shrimp. I ended up picking out the shrimp instead of sending it back because we had a movie to catch and I was starving by the time we got our food. But, yikes. Lettuce wraps were ok. Wine was meh.

It tasted like it had been cooked a few days before and refrigerated.  And I think they must really be cutting corners ... yes a TABLESPOON.  C'mon dudes!

I am sure this place at one time had good intentions as a mom 'n pop local Mexican restaurant, but it is clear everyone involved--customers included--have become complacent with crappy food.

We sat at the bar to watch the rolls be made plus we are bar people.  As they are fixing the rolls I notice my boyfriends eyes get really big.  Two guys are making the rolls and one has gloves and ones does not.  The one with out gloves proceeds to stick his finger in some sauce put the finger in his mouth to taste then continue to make the rolls. We assumed this was the owner with the way he was acting.  They burnt one of the rolls therefore it took 30+ mins to get our food. We were 2 of the only 3 people in the restaurant. When they brought the soup to me it was boiling in the cup.  Let us just say this place needs some serious help\n",
            "My wife and I have been dinning at this Maudie's for about four and a half years.  However, service and quality of the food has been steadily declining for the past six months or so.  I order the \"Rockin Ruthann's with steak fajita meat and extra raw onions.  The last four visits, my order has been either delivered to the table wrong (hamburger, chicken or no onions) or in one case the order was not submitted.   The manager is always quick to offer a reduced cost, or a gift card, but that is not the point.  I have always insisted on paying for my meal - I just want them address why they cannot get the order straight and return to the kind of restaurant they used to be\n",
            "Terrible place. Would never go back there. They told us in line it was $20 and then after waiting in line for over 30 mins and then change the price to $25 once we get to the front. They were extremely rude, terrible customer service. I will not be back.\n",

            "Last week I took friends from out of town to brunch there and we waited over an hour and a half for a table for 7. We were told it is be a 45-50 minute wait. With two children in our party the quoted wait time was about the max we could wait. One we got to that time we felt it was better to stay then leave as we were very rudely told it would be \"any minute now.\" We totally should have left. Once we finally made it inside, the gentleman at the front counter stared down everyone in our party as we walked by to be seated. I said good afternoon to him and he said nothing in return. Extremely rude. Our server was nice but the food took a long time and we had had about enough of the place. We ate and left quickly but not until we paid the rude fellow at the counter. Again, I tried to make conversation and he literally did not say a word in response. \n",
            "I get that the food in unique as is the atmosphere but I do not pay money anywhere to be treated so poorly. I think Lucile's thinks they can act this way because people will come anyways. I have got news for you... What once was out out-of-town guests favorite has become a place they, and I, never care to visit again. Waste of time and money.\n",

            "I will forever avoid them for any bakery needs. For a company event I was planning, against my better judgement, after initially being laughed at for asking for quote & having the woman on the phone be very curt to me when I inquired about them doing an event, I chose to use Jaciva's for a large cupcakes order. They refused to accommodate my simple request for a special color for the cupcake wrapper. Wanting to get these cupcakes taken care of and focus on the big picture of the event, I said OK, I will provide a special cupcake collar to achieve the look I want for my event. Low and behold, there ended up being a last minute issue with one of the Jaciva's employees not passing along a very important message about the delivery of the cupcake collars to the bakery. When I arrived to the bakery the morning of the event at 9am (opening time) with the cupcake collars the woman very rudely told me that the cupcakes had already been sent to our venue, and I would have to take care of putting the special collar on them myself. Myself. The day of. For 100+ cupcakes. I honestly felt like they could not care less about my satisfaction. It was absolutely unacceptable, and I was appalled. Bottom line, if you do not want to stress about a bakery order being taken care of properly and politely, do not use Jaciva's.\n",
            "Almost literally half of my orders the times I have been here have been wrong. I used to think it was a language barrier but even ordering food online is the same way. So inconsistent. Either the staff or the chef's do not understand what is on their own menu .\n",
            "THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. Tara, my group's server, was rude and unorganized. Our food was very slow coming out and when it came out, she brought 2 plates every 5-10 minutes. To play the devil's advocate, it was around midnight and there were more people in the restaurant than on a normal Saturday night but she did not need to be rude. When we first came in we asked if the tables could be moved to accommodate for our group of 12 and her was \"You can go ahead and move them.\" We ordered shortly after being seated and it took 20-30 minuted to get our drinks. At our table she brought out some of our food before our drinks. When we asked to have our drinks before our food she replied, \"Well unless you want your food cold and your drinks hot  you will be served like this.\" When we got our  drinks she ran out of straws and said she would be back with more. She never came back with anymore straws; my friend had to get up and ask another waiter for some. When I finally received my pancake, 45 minutes after ordering, i grabbed the old fashioned syrup and started to pour; it was a blueberry. I told our server and she said,\" Well she what you Coulda done was grab the Old fashion of this table and used it. See how easy that was.\" When my table started to get checks one of my friends had not even received her food. When she finally got her food, everyone was already finished with their food. Our table left and Tara received no tip. Some people did not pay because they either did not receive their check or they got their food 4 minutes before we left. The food was ok. but the service was not.\n",

            "My family and I were at Duffys last night and realized that your \"2-4-1\" are not really \"2-4-1\". The atmosphere and service was great but we were very unhappy with how you cheat people with your advertisements and prices. I had coronas, typically a $4/$4.50 beer. When I go somewhere and they are advertised  2-4-1, I am thinking I am getting 2 beers for the price of $4/$4.50. When receiving my bill it stated $6 dollars \"2-4-1\", that means you either charge $6 for one beer or in reality your charging $3 each and trying to say it is 2-4-1. For coronas $3 is not bad but when speaking to the managers and learning that this is what you charge for every beer its just insane. Duffys is over pricing their drinks and by slapping \"2-4-1\" on it, makes everyone tricked into what they are actually paying for. I got \"2-4-1\" Bloddy Mary's and saw the bill of $8. That means really I just paid $4 a drink or Duffys really thinks their well Bloody Mary's are worth $8. I could go next door to Liam's happy Hour and get two Bloody Marys for $3.50 each and it would still be cheaper then what your \"2-4-1\" special is. What makes it all worst is when you ask what one drink cost without the 2-4-1, you cannot get a answer just a 2-4-1 price.Like I said the overall experience was great but learning how this franchise is cheating people of their money and getting away with false advertisement will never get a dollar from me again. I will be happy to spread the word.\n",
            "Used to be a fine place many years ago. We visited it twice in 2013. Both times a total flop. Just had drinks the first time. Fruit flies on the inside of the glass, some drowned. Waitress said, \"Oh well, the alcohol kills any germs\" ( Really!!!). We left.\n",

The place seemed dark and dingy and generally felt dirty. The food was terrible. Really terrible - even the french fries were gross. The women's room had 3 stalls, two of which were missing toilet seats. I could go on and on but I think my point is made. Go somewhere else even if you have to wait.\n",

No \"we are putting it on the grill right now\" no \"we are putting it at the top of the list.\" Can I go to the kitchen because making a burger literally takes 15 minutes. Max. Do not go here. Ever.

I ordered at it off time, so it was not like it was peak busy hours - the delivery said it would be here in 30 minutes, took almost an hour and like I said it was cold. Is the food good, not sure. The Pepsi I ordered was cold, I suppose that is a win.  She asked if I wanted a credit or another pizza and I requested a hot pizza and offered to give her the cold one back.

After an afternoon of walking around, and standing at the bar to have two drinks each, my friend and I were looking forward to sitting down.  The woman next to us who was eating dinner got up to leave, and literally before we could move over to take her seats (she had her backpack on one of them) the guy yanked them out of the way.

It was basically some watered down red sauce and then a bunch of sriracha on top. There were only about 5 tiny pieces of chicken in the dish, some onions and bell peppers, and it was 85% white rice. The white rice did not even taste good. Probably one of the worst food stands I have experienced in Austin.\n",

I have had my fair share of spaghetti bolognese but this was the complete opposite. I am 90% sure I was eating rotten meat because it tasted sour, but I thought it could have been the cheese.

Not to mention, the fries, nuggets and other food is cold and not as fresh as it used to be. I do not plan on visiting here anymore.

The chicken fried steak was gristly and no flavor at all even with the white pepper gravy. I am sure the food we ordered from the onion rings to the fried catfish was frozen food.

            "Everyone has a bad day and I am sure the restaurant business is a very difficult one, but there is no excuse for poor service, downright unclean surroundings and waiting for more than 15 minutes with no appearance of service staff. Had there been a crowd, it might have been excusable but there were few patrons, the restaurant was less than ¼ full.  I literally had to ask to be waited on.  I would have walked out but there was a member of our party that wanted to be there so the rest of us relented. Let me tell you about the unclean part.  The blinds were covered in dust with a sprinkling of various sauces.  The menus were greasy and smudged. The salt and pepper shakers were slimy. Both garbage cans in the Ladies room were overflowing and was very dirty looking.  There was a water leak from one of the machines in the service area and water was tracked around the front entrance, the tiles were icy slick, I am shocked that someone did not slip, fall and crack their skull.  The plastic drinking glasses were old and chipped. Even the windows looked dirty.  The furnishings looked old and overused. Many tables were not cleared for the duration of our visit. It was obvious that there was no care or pride put into the running of this establishment. My gut reaction was to run out the door.  After requesting service a young man stepped up and waited on us.  He was very good at his job but the food took forever to get to us, we were there for over 2 hours.  The prices are in my opinion unreasonable, we had $10 off coupons which helped.  Here is the tragic part, the food was actually pretty good.  I could not really enjoy it because of all the gross factors. This place needs to hire a deep cleaning crew and they really need to spruce up and do repairs. No one wants to see a pool of water standing in the serving area. No one wants to use a filthy bathroom and no one wants to wonder about the horrors that must be in the kitchen based what is seen about the entire restaurant​.  I will never - ever go back, there is no coupon good enough or companion insistence that will get me back in there.\n",
            "Seriously it is worth the wait!? We waited freaking an hour and a half for a table and they had the audacity to give away our table for getting there five minutes late. As soon as they texted our party we went there. So now they are making us wait 30 minutes longer. Sooooo pissed.\n",

Usually training involves a trainer, which did not exist at the point of purchase. I asked them to take some accountability for their mistake, some argument ensued, and we were still at the $1.50 standpoint. \n",

            "And now we get to the salad. They give this great piece of bread, nice amount of feta, and a worthy amount of chicken for the slight additional cost. I was now eating my salad after I drove back to pick up my dressing, and realized it had no tomatoes. It also had what appeared, and tasted to be, some sort of dried fruit like an apricot. Definitely a traditional ingredient in a Greek salad, and absolutely included (not) on the website ingredient list. \n",

            "Joe, if you are reading this, I expressed my concerns to your employee that answered the phone and was offered $1.50. To go back to pick up the dressing probably cost me as much in gas as was offered because of this mistake. Just to go back home and eat cold mozzarella sticks and cold chicken on my salad. This is my first yelp review and my last trip to your establishment. Unfortunately we both lost during this transaction, you need a new customer, and I need a new Greek salad spot.\n",

Go to the bar where the bar tender did not even know how to write water in her book. Long story short...it took 45 mins for our orders. They all came out seperate!

Well little did we know that the private table only seats five or so people. Everyone else had to stand in a small area near the table. Three other large groups who also had private tables had to pass through our area just to get to theirs, which made finding a place to stand without continually being bumped almost impossible. \n",

Except that when we got there and our waitress finally arrived, she informed us that we would have to order a bottle from the menu. And a bottle of just about anything was at LEAST $250 or so. So we finally reluctantly ordered a bottle of vodka. We then found out that only the waitress is allowed to pour the vodka, and she has the 3 other VIP groups to serve as well. So she would come to each table, pour whatever drinks we wanted (there were pitchers of OJ, cranberry juice, and soda water to mix with), and then leave us with a cup of vodka to pour ourselves before she came back again with our bottle. Seems like a very poor system.\n",

I had a bad experience at the old Vancouver one (closed now...hmmm), so I quit going. Decided to try again and still disappointed. A lot of money for such slow service.

Our waiters excuse was that different guest wanted to pay for certain items and  she was unable to separate items ...why did not she just drop the check first and mention it to us was out of my comprehension.

The service was poor only because they were extremely understaffed. Our waitress did the best she could. Food was just really bad- the olives were cold and tasted sour almost like it was full of preservatives out of a old jar from the back of your refrigerator. The stuff peppers were awful and the cream like innards were terrible. ( I am sorry) and then we called it quits when some small circular omelet dish came out that looked sad. Nothing had flavor & if it did it was bitter or sour.  However the drinks were good, weak for the most part but I prefer them this way. Most would not..\n",

Waitress was friendly but I almost pitied her for having to serve such pathetic dishes. \"Sautéed mushrooms\" were the slimy  canned variety and I can assure you they never saw the inside of a sauté pan. The \" grilled shrimp\"'we are rubbery, and flavorless. 6 oz sirloin was like shoe leather. To say the food was lame.... Would be kind. Having enjoyed decent meals at other locations, it was truly a letdown and  we will never return to this Logan's Roadhouse.\n",

I love concepts where a nice spot does coffee/beer & wine/booze/food but they miss the mark on all fronts. The coffee was weak & watery (& I ordered a double macchiato, which is pretty much straight espresso) & the croissant was like one of those mushy pastries you get in a bag at the gas station.

Which in a highly competitive market might actually mean they really just do not care enough - to not have really researched what is going on in the culinary world, and the food they are doing is so basic it should not be hard to do. It is not like they are struggling with a new concept. Flavorless egg & potato is ridiculous. Throw some chives in there. Salt at the least, paprika. Anything really. Crappy jarred olives that you are calling Spanish olives like you would see on a nice tapas menu is ridiculous. Those are going to require some olive oil & spices. \n",

There is no quality control here - when I order rapid pickup, it is like they rely on you not checking your order until it is too late (because you need to get out of there *rapidly*) so they do not care if they get it right. Tonight I ordered four meals, each is supposed to come with a side - got 3 sides. Two of those meals were full-size salad - the salad boxes were at most half full. Ultimately, I think if the prices were about a third less than what they are, I might  not complain, but this is an expensive place that is supposed to be fast and quality, and I am just continually disappointed by forgotten items/elements, sloppily assembled sandwiches, and way smaller portions than you get when you actually eat in the store.\n",

First of all we were asked to go to a timeshare meeting for 90 minutes and sit through a presentation and the gentlemen, or should I say so-called gentleman, Brian Campos how does over almost three hours, even though we told him we had a church luncheon that we could not be late for.  He then told us that there would be no problem after us going through the presentation and all they wanted from us would be a simple yes or a simple no. That is all he said and that was extremely extremely false and misleading. After we told him that we could not afford the trip and did not want the timeshare he began being very insulting to all of us stating \"oh so you guys just came here for the trip and wasted my time\". Then after we all four of us told him no respectfully and told him that we would like to wrap this up and collect our promotional gift he left the table and comes back with his manager who then keeps us there for another 30 minutes while he tries to sell us on how he can help us get the price now. We politely told him that we were on a time crunch and had to go to our church luncheon he very rudely replied \"I heard you the first time\". Then finally we told him no again probably for the 15th time and then he finally walked away along with Ryan Campos. About two minutes later a third person walks up and tries to sell us another type of timeshare and again we had to sit there and tell him no several times and then he left rudely. No one really ever directed us to where we were supposed to pick up our tickets after I guess they could not get us a lot of us they pretty much said to hell with us. Watch out for these tricksters and swindlers they were you in with the promise of tickets to some attraction or free dinner and then when they know that is what you are there for they get angry when you turn them down for the timeshare, its not like they did not know why you came in the first place and I am sure it was not to buy a timeshare. Even though they kept telling us that one out of every for families purchases I did not see much of that going on, especially for a property that smells like mildew and an NFL locker room. Not to mention just walking around the property it smells like an open sewer and I believe they have four by four sewer grates does hanging around in the parking lot that stinks and reeked of swamp gas and feces. My family and I have never felt so harassed and so degraded by people trying sell us property for $15000, that is not worth $15.  all in all it was a horrible experience and ruin that day for our  8 day vacation that we were spending florida. I am warning everyone now never cross into the westgate lakes resort parking lot. do not buy!!! run run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. they will make you feel horrible that either you do not make enough money or you just do not want a timeshare at all. do not let them make you feel bad about making your own choices especially at a place that you do not want to stay at because of rude timeshare reps and a property that is not up to par with all their fancy videos and slideshows.\n",

There were trace amounts of peanuts (probably because they do not enhance the dish's sweetness) and literally four pieces of soggy green onions.

I had higher expectations, I was actually excited to try it out. Oh, and that was not even the only bad part of our experience there. The server ignored us for the most part even before this hair incident. She took forever to get our drink orders because she ran into an old coworker walking by and just forgot she was actually working. She took forever to put in the food order. The food took forever to come out. And all this was early in the evening, they were not busy at all! I think she had a total of two tables. I mean the whole restaurant had about 5-6 tables. They did take care of the bill, that was nice of them, however, she did not come back to check on us after that. AT ALL. After we were done, we actually had to wave someone else down to make sure that we were good to go. Needless to say, we went be going there again.\n",

Overall the service was fine - our server worked hard for us and was very apologetic but the food was not. Also, did I mention that there was not a family friendly restroom, no changing tables. Honestly very disappointed.\n",

First, this place had super bad customer service; we would ask for soy sauce and chili paste oil and they gave us two tiny thing of it for 5 people to share and once I asked if we could get more in a nicely manner we did not get any at all. No one here spoke English so they did not understand anything at all. Second, the food was crap, flavoring was off and did not taste like great dim sum like we had before in other restaurants. The shrimp did not taste like shrimp, it tasted and smelled like a wet ragged. I do not recommend this place to anyone who loves dim sum like I do, it will be a waste of your time and money.\n",

Is there someone waiting on the tables in the section we are moving to?\" She said yes and that she would send someone over. We moved and played pool for about 2 1/2 hours with NO SERVICE.

The food was tasteless and the staff overbearing and incompetent. The waitress forgot my bf's rice order and when we asked for it she said we had not ordered that. Ok, fine. Rather than wait we shared my small order of rice. Halfway through our meal she comes out with his rice, OOPS she had forgotten about it.

After 15 minutes we went back and asked about our table. Her response was that it would be about 20 minutes more. After being seated, I ordered pork schnitzel with mashed potatoes and a salad. The food took a very long time to arrive and when it did, it was chicken schnitzel instead of pork. The salad was pathetic and inedible. It was basically the white core of iceberg lettuce, a teaspoon of dressing, and some other vegetables. The mashed potatoes were bland and terrible. Schnitzel was mediocre. That dish is $14.99. No thank you. I sampled some other food from our party like the brats and sauerkraut balls. They were just okay. For the price, I expected more than slow service and underwhelming food. I will certainly take my business elsewhere.\n",

We have not eaten real food (only plane snacks) since noon west coast time, since we have been on the plane the whole time, we were just hungry. They tell us to keep waiting.

The food was barely warm, and mostly closer to room temperature. We ordered the Taiwan Style Wonton Soup - the soup was flavorless, the noodles were mushy, but the wontons had decent flavor to them. The soup tasted like a watered down version of how the soup should be. We also got the beef fried rice, which was fine for fried rice. We also got the Panfried Pork Buns Shanghai Style, which was cold by the time we got it, so it was pretty gross. I cannot speak to how it might taste when it is warm.\n",

I am not a picky eater by any stretch, so when I tell you that the vegetable pad Thai was hands-down the worst that I have ever tried, then that should mean something.

Then about 10min later, she comes to our table and yells for the entire restaurant to hear, \"We cannot serve you your drink because your ID does not meet our restaurants standards.\" and quickly walks away. I am 23, there is nothing wrong with my ID. I have ordered drinks at hundreds of restaurants including Babica. My ID was new because my wallet had gotten stolen earlier this year, I have never had ANY issue with my ID anywhere. Frances does not offer any explanation or substitute drink order. After that the customer service absolutely plummeted. I go the rest of my meal annoyed and getting weird looks from people. Our food takes forever to come out and my friend and I leave the restaurant unhappy. \n",

            "I had a disappointing first experience at VVV and will not return.  I regret not having gone to the other Buckhead life restaurants instead.  First, it should have been an indication that the restaurant was empty at 7:00 p.m. on a weekend.  Anyway, the waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu and I regret not having asked more questions.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this until the food arrived.  Several appetizers were mediocre and salty.  I will admit that the bread was tasty.  The ossobucco was good.  Agnoletto was okay, but overall too rich and doughy.  The lasagna noodles were also doughy and hard and the presentation was not as expected.  I do not know if the pasta was made improperly or not cooked enough.  Anyway, instead of having a layered lasagna, we were presented with a slab of lasagna noodles with meat sauce mixed in.  I expected it to be layers of pasta cut into a square shape.  Based on the presentation, I am assuming this place is not busy enough to bake a lasagna casserole, so they make a deconstructed version.  My first reaction upon seeing the lasagna was to ask if they had served me the wrong dish.  The sauce was okay, but the pasta was not good.  Also, the size of the noodles in relation to the meats auce made it unmanageable.  I would have preferred to have spaghetti with meat sauce. I wish I had sent this dish back as most of it ended up in the trash anyway.  Finally, my stomach hurt when I left.  Check out one of the other Buckheadlife life restaurants and avoid this one.\n",

            "This HAS to be the worst Indian food on the planet. I ordered the bento box tbat came with lentils, rice, choice of veggie and choice of chicken with a mini-bite-sized samosa. I had 2 bites of the lentils and wanted to spit it up;bland, watered down, and flavorless. The basmati rice tasted old, cold, and slightly hard. The channa Masala was slightly good, the flavor was almost there But also cold. The vindaloo chicken was spicy, but lacked authenticity and the Naan was pita-like, cold, no ghee, no garlic, no flavor. The winner was the tiny bite-sized samosa that packed so much flavor that this is the only thing I ate. I threw away about 95% of my food in the garbage and I am NOT a wasteful person. It takes ALOT for me to throw away food, but unfortunately it was inedible. Deeply saddened since I have been craving Indian food and when it is cold or rainy that is when the craving hits me the most... it was a perfect day for Indian food, but apparently curry2u did not get the memo.\n",

We finally flagged down a waiter to took an order for drinks for him to never return. Everything just went downhill from there. Food was gross but the mimosas were tasty. Unfortunately, no one gave me an opportunity to get another.  Manager was nice and understood our frustration and attempted to make it right but it was already too late. The spot is cool and music was as well. I just would not advise going to sit and eat.\n",

First off there was water all over the floor, we had to be really careful not to slip-accident waiting to happen. We placed our order and waited about 10 minutes got our food but  it was mixed up, spicy chicken with the wrong side, I asked for butter and honey for biscuits but he said they do not  offer it. Then we need a to go box so I stood at the counter for about 10 minutes, they saw me but would not come and help. Finally the Pepsi guy walked thru and I asked him to hand me a box. Extremely unprofessional and rude kids working here. Do not give them your business\n",

He seems to be the only male employee there.  All the girls are super nice though.\n",

It was not even busy, yet there was no one available to take our order. By the time a server came to our lane, they told us the kitchen was closed and that we could not get any food! Then it took them another 20 minutes to bring us our drinks... And this was when only half the lanes were occupied. In my opinion, I would skip this place if you are in the mood for bowling and head over to Brunswick instead (to save yourself the frustration). Video games are similar to D&Bs but with less variety. So you might as well go to D&Bs! Long story short.. Steer clear until their customer service improves.\n",
            "We recently moved to this neighborhood and decided to give this place a try. We went here for dinner. The taste was good and I was loving my food. My husband was sick, so he ordered the normal pesarattu instead of the masala pesarattu. After the long wait, he got the pesarattu with the masala. He politely called the waiter and said he had the wrong order. When the waiter went in and asked the lady who prepared the order, she was very RUDE and shouted \"why cannot they take out the masala and eat\". We were shocked by the way the lady responded. The poor waiter apologized to us, but the lady did not even care to apologize for her behavior.\n",

Mind you, this was the second bad visit in the last couple of months. The food has gone down hill, the place is looking dingy, and the service is now apathetic. I guess the owner has checked out since the employees say they are never around. I think I have covered the bases.\n",
            "Very poor quality sushi. The restaurant is very dirty inside, they do not wipe down the seats and I almost sat in a glob of wasabi. There is a layer of greasy filth all over the open kitchen area. I cannot believe they are still in business, but since their prices are cheap and they have a conveyor belt that brings different plates around the table can seem interesting.  I have eaten there only a few times hoping that the cleaning will improve but it does not and every time I feel sick afterwards.\n",

Then 10 minutes passed, still no utensils, we asked again and a different server told us that they did not have any more, that they kept going missing. This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table.  We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.  I would give them a negative star if I could. The food was NOT worth the money it cost us.\n",

What a bad start to this experience.  The voucher expires tomorrow and I do not have time to come back another day.

When we walked in, no one greeted us at all until I asked a server if we could sit anywhere. She said someone would be with us shortly. 5 mins after just awkwardly standing around, we were told there was a 15 minute wait (although I counted 4 empty tables). When we were finally seated, a server came and did not introduce himself but started filling our glasses with water and removing plates from the table. Our \"real\" server finally came and although he greeted us with no smile he did tell us his name! We quickly ordered food and appetizers since we had already been waiting for a while but lo and behold we had to wait 30 minutes for our hummus appetizer (after having to remind another server for it). I was tempted to ask for an apron to put my own hummus on the plate... When we finally got our food (2 minutes after the appetizer came) my boyfriend began to cut into his supposedly medium-rare venison burger while my dad and I snuck fries off the plate. Our server comes up with another burger plate and informs us that we are in fact cutting into someone else's burger. I explained to him that we had already cut the burger and were eating fries off the plate and he said that is OK we will take care of it. I expected him to leave us the wrong burger since we had already begun to eat off of the plate but he said that they would just switch the bun. I told him again that we had already eaten off the plate and he said that is OK and took the burger away. We cut into the second burger and it was well-done unfortunately. My brussels sprouts were swimming in oil, but the capers were a nice addition. My dad got the venison pizza which was OK but pretty devoid of any flavor. Our server came over at the end and never asked us how our food was and never smiled (ever) and we were left feeling slightly full but mostly disappointed.\n",

            "These guys are awful. Dominos pizza has always been mediocre on a good day, and disconcerting on a bad day. But this place has awful service. I have had delivery guys literally say nothing more than a single grunt to me. I once had a delivery guy try to tell me that he was not going to give me back the change I asked for, instead he would decide how much of a tip I would get. They are awful. If you have another choice, take it. I feel dirty ever using this place.\n",

            "I am not sure how I managed to let my friend talk me into going to this \"restaurant\", but if she wants to go back then she will be on her own because it was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. The food tastes stale, for starters. You could easily make every single item off their menu at home yourself, and it would probably taste better too. Secondly, if you are thinking about ordering food to go or want to take your leftovers home in a goodie bag, do not do it! The owner of the restaurant (an older Asian woman) berates and yells at her employees, who are running themselves so ragged that they barely have time to ask how your meal is. If I could give NO stars on this restaurant review then I would. They are terrible!"

Food was ok service was terrible because I was not a regular, I had followed their wait list protocol but after a couple of they are regualars came in ( stafff and customers knew each other by first name basis) they we are seated before me. Staff just pretended not to acknowledge what I just saw and re assured me I would be seated within 15 minutes. It was moderately busy after being seated I felt they just wanted me and my family in and out did not bring me napkins, or a soup spoon For my ramen! Did not refill my water , After being seated no one came back to check on me until the check was ready I do not expect to be treated like royalty but basic customer service goes a long way with me or anyone they lost a customer. Will not be coming back I guess just stick with what you know..\n",

Called back, placed on hold for quite a while, they called on the other line unaware that I was on hold with them already, and after having to repeat myself several times, was told she would call to tell them I would pick it up.

            "The service was great and fast but the quality of the food is terrible. I ordered an 18\" pizza with broccoli, spinach, mushrooms and chicken and a greek salad. The salad was most iceberg lettuce, barely any veges, like 3 olives, 2 pieces of tomato and drowning in feta cheese. The dressing comes in a packet which has high fructose corn syrup.\n",
            "The pizza: the crust was terrible quality, like thin, weak tasting stale white bread. The sauce was tasteless and the vegetables were overcooked and the chicken was totally dried out. As the pizza cooled it got worse. If you like QUALITY food and really enjoy a good slice, this is NOT the place for you. If you are more into substantial quantity then this is the place for you. Large portions, great service, HORRIBLE quality food.\n",
            "This was my first time dining at Paul's since it re-opened. The reason it is even getting 2 stars is because the food is good. They clearly forgot to put our order in because we waited 45 minutes until we said something. No one approached us to apologize for the wait, and never acknowledged that the order was never put in in the first place. Then when we went to pay, they offered us a $5 gift card that we could not use on our current bill. I do not think I will be going back to use that $5 gift card. Very disappointed in the service.\n",
            "The Factory aesthetically appeals the the hipster foodie scene that has taken the Austin food scene by storm. The location provides New Orleans Style coffee and other standard cafe foods. Disclaimer: the cafe has a \"no laptop\" policy to force human interaction. Interaction proves difficult when the cafe was mostly empty the entire time I was there, giving me time to stew on all the aspects of the cafe I truly disliked. \n",
            "\n",
            "Ambiance: the cafe was cutely decorated and provided a variety of sitting environments from cozy couches to counters with stools. There was no strict style scheme which was novel yet displeasing. The light fixtures hang low, and the art on the walls was a bit of an eye sore. Overall, I would give the ambiance a 3/5. Did not do more. Did not do less. \n",

            "Coffee: For those who have never tried New Orleans Style coffee, the process incorporates a Chicory Plant that helps smooth and strengthen the coffee flavors, but if you are unprepared and unaccustomed to that flavor, the coffee tastes like it was made in a soapy dirty cup. The chicory flavor becomes aggressively pronounced in pour over and americanos. I did not enjoy the coffee whatsoever, and with the \"no laptop\" policy, I had no distraction from the truly unpleasant coffee experience. \n",

            "The Factory was just adequate. It did not provide a great (or even good) coffee experience, but the space has potential to be good. I did not venture to try food, but if the menu was fresh and quality, that would be a redeeming quality for me personally.\n",

The waitresses were sitting and talking, not sure if the manager was training or what, but he was sitting with them. We ordered wings and shrimp, the food was not great, but it was ok. I would not recommend it.\n",
            "I would love to give 4.5 star reviews for food and ambience BUT the service is painstakingly slow. I have been coming here for years. But the service is too too slow. Understand it is not fast food but it definitely can be faster. If you have a lot of time and lounge around, good place to come. I have an hour to stay and have a meal but you need atleast 1.5 hours minimum here.\n",
            "I do not understand how this place gets such high ratings. Note: I am of Indian descent, so maybe I am not the target market for this \"accessible-style\" cuisine. To me, the food is \"meh,\" at best. \n",

            "Dinner is a la carte, but the quality is not much better. The Samosa Chaat is pretty bland, surprising given the preparation, which on arrival had so much potential. I also had the Vegetable Ayam, which was passable but left me feeling a bit ill from the overt creaminess, and the Bhindi Masala which was okay, if bland. \n",

            "The servers do not seem to know much about the food, or the wines, and are generally lackadaisical in their attitude. We were in a group and had a variety of naans ordered, but they were all mixed up in baskets and unceremoniously deposited at random on the table without any explanation of what each one was. We were left to attempt to figure it out in the massively under-lit dining room.\n",

            "Service was decent, I did a to go order of the cod fish and chips and a side of fried cheese curds 40+ $ with a small tip. The cheese curds which we ate on our way home were extremely greasy and clumped together in one big saugy mess. The fish was cooked perfectly and the batter was chrispy the biggest issue was there was no flavor!!!\n",

She was back there for like 20 minutes... who knows what the dog was doing. Highly disgusting and unprofessional in my opinion.\n",
            "I thought this was one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. Too bready and saucy with very little cheese. The Caesar salad was fresh. For $14 I think the entire thing is overpriced. We pretty much all left our pizzas. I also noticed others who left most of their pizza. I could only eat one slice. So disappointed! :( I say eat elsewhere.\n",
            "It is an okay place if you want a good place to hangout and chat.  The wine list was not impressive.  The wine tasting is fun but wish the wines were better.\n",

            "It might have been a great experience if only I had been warned that the \"premium\" seat I was assigned was soaked from a previous person. A blanket was thrown over the seat to hide the spill. The server admitted that she knew about it but could not move me.No extra charge for lemons in the seat as well. Very uncomfortable to be wet and then chilled from A.C. Noted that the bathrooms are not as clean as they should be and the blankets they give you smell  bad. Dim lighting is apparently hiding a lot of poor upkeep. Very disappointed.\n",
            "Two stars is giving them the bonus of a rounding up from one star and change. The place was packed at 7:00p on a Friday and good for them, making money is why you are in the business after all. Do not set your expectations too high, it is not an uppity type of place, just what we were looking to try. Yes, 1st time at a BJ's, ever.\n",
            "\n",
            "Very sticky floor on the way over to the bar. Something must have spilled and was not cleaned up well at all. Our drinks were served within reasonable wait. We started with the Ultimate Iced Teas and chose to finish with them even though they were just okay ($10/ea.). Service was a very solid average. Reading the menu I notice the \"deep dish\" pizza. and think that is a great starter piece. We ordered the small sized (size #2 of 4) Classic Combo and added onion/pepper. The pizza came in expected time, however, it was just warm and not hot. The dough was chewy and seamed under-cooked. Toppings we distributed in an acceptable amount. Note: nothing \"great\" happening here, never mind excellent. Next we ordered the calamari. There was a reasonable amount and it was very warm, still not hot. But the squid was horrible. The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long. We are no strangers to some fried squid and this dish had to be worst I have ever had. Because of this, we closed out. Five drinks, two app's, no dinner.\n",
            "Found this place on Yelp. Upon entry, you may notice the Mandarin speaking chefs. But that does not matter - the amount of rice they use in a roll is diabetes-concerning. A roll, the diameter of a can of Coke, uses approximately 60% white rice and 40% ingredients. That is a terrible ROI.\n",
            "My friend and I visited the restaurant on a evening. Although there was not a huge crowd or people waiting, our waiter rushed us in to ordering cocktails and appetizers. The spicy tuna roll and fried calamari was excellent. However our entrees that we ordered hibachi style were terrible! The chef was quite entertaining and friendly but he served us raw scallops and gummy rice. The noodles had no flavor, the vegetables were not cooked properly, and the servings were small. I will definitely not visit this restaurant again.\n",

            "We went back acouple of nights ago. the bartender was visibly pissed about something... maybe the fact that he was getting his ass handed to him and his manager was more worried about drinking a glass of wine!! However, the food again was amazing! If you want a place that you can fall in love with food, hyde park is it. Do Not count on the service knocking your socks off, just wear sandals so you cannot be disappointed...\n",

            "Not impressed. Food selection was sparse for the price. Mongolian Grill was the best part of the food. Hot and Sour Soup was barely okay. The chili oil was pretty good though, and the iced tea was absolutely delicious.\n",
            "I do not understand why this place has such good reviews. The cheese is blotchy and not stringy, the tomato sauce tastes weird and their toppings are no good. The only thing we liked was the crust. We ordered 3 pizzas and it was def not worth the 30.00, not coming back here again.\n",

            "Maybe my view would change if I tried another time, but I doubt that will happen. Have only had take out. Meat is good, not great. Sandwich poorly made, skimpy portions, though bread pretty good. But the price...fugeddaboutit!\n",

            "The food....the downfall. The chips were great, but we kept having to ask for more. The table side gauc was okay, fresh but lacking some serious heat and flavor. Tasted like mashed up avocados. I tried the duck mini-fajitas at $18.95 a pop. Let me tell you, there were MINI. I do not think I have ever left a restaurant still hungry, but I was (maybe that is why the margaritas seems so strong??) It came with about 2 tablespoons of meat and 3 tortillas you could buy at stop and shop. My friend got the short rib \"mini-fajitas\" as well....same deal, decent tasting but lacking food. Not impressed. Others in my party got basic items like fish tacos (super fishy tasting, I thought they were heinous) and fillet fajitas (the meat was def not fillet). I feel like I could get the same food by heating up a mexican lean cuisine.\n",

I was completely wrong - it tasted like bland, mushy lentils with a piece of melted cheese on a toasted bun that was already soggy. This might be the worst veggie burger I have ever tried. Where is the flavor?!? Where the texture?!?  Hopefully they reformulate the recipe and come up with something awesome.\n",

The park  is dated and most area's have a 70's decor feel. THE FOOD IS AWFUL!!!

The waitress said, \"Yeah, they did not get their timing right.\"  The pizza seemed undercooked - the underside was so pale.  For a hearth pizza, I was expected it to be blazing hot and blistered.  It looked like a doughy microwaved pizza.  Waitress never refilled our water glasses.  She seemed overwhelmed.  Why cannot the bored hostess refill glasses?  Seems poorly run.  I think they get away with the so-so pizza because the place is mostly full of diners with young children.\n",
            "We made it just before they closed at 7pm on a weekday. They were definitely in a rush to get people out. It was not too crowded. But I thought it was bad that they had ran out of stuff we did not order like lemonade and coke but then when I ordered it they were out of okra to be fried. So I was disappointed! The cornbread you can pass on. It was dry and reminded me of that box cornbread mix from Martha White. The banana pudding they gave us free was gross; too sweet and taste mostly like bananas just mashed up. The fried fish whiting was cooked very well. The seasoning and batter used was good. Collard greens good. Potato salad was gross. Blackeyed peas were good.  Overall it was an experience and I would return for that fish.\n",

We came at lunch so we ordered two entrees off the main menu as well as al lunch special. The pad thai was made with thick noodles and was really really sweet. It had way too thick of a sauce and although had some prawns, the proportion of noodles to other ingredients was way off. The chicken stir fry with thai black bean sauce was again, sugary sweet and extremely oily. Because of the coupon, this was an okay deal but it was no different from chinese style stir fry. Finally, the red curry with prawns in a young coconut was the best of the bunch. It was extremely coconutty and was very flavourful. For around 12 dollars, this was also a good lunch deal! \n",

My last two times have made me sad - one time the aioli was broken - basically an oily mess.  This last time the oil (tallow) used to make my chicken tenders was clearly burnt.  I tried to eat the chicken, hoping it did not taste as bad as it smelled, but it had the burnt oil taste.  When I took them back, the employee - though definitely gracious - said maybe it was just the way the tallow tasted.  That was a bit confusing because 1) should not she know how they taste normally?  and 2) tallow or any oil should not taste burnt.  She took them back and gave me my money back but I was left with an empty stomach and a sad heart.  I cannot really think of any other cart in SE that could replace CC for me but on the other hand I do not know that I want to go back to this location and be disappointed again.\n",

We did not have to wait very long before a young lady stopped by and took our order.  We were lucky with our waitress because we noticed two other tables that had to get up and find their server.  The bar had stacked up dirty drink ware; the servers were putting the fruit in the drinks and three tables in the bar were not cleaned while we were there for an hour.  We had the nachos with chicken and while not bad, they were not close to the picture that was in the menu.  There were not a shortage of wait staff, just a shortage of them taking care of business.

Mistakes happen moving on. Our meal came after another 20 minutes( this is a long time am I right) and both were missing one side each. The waitress that had brought our food,not our waitress, went to ask our waitress about it because it was not on the ticket (not far from our table, I heard the whole conversation). The waitress came over and said she was looking into it. The manager then reappeared saying she was going to comp the shrimp they had forgot to put on our plate, but this is the real kicker for me she said to us that the kitchen burnt the shrimp. I JUST HEARD THE WAITRESS! Why lie? I do not like that she blamed her kitchen staff, I am a fair person and I respect when people own their mistakes. I do not respect placing the blame. \n",

            "Came to Boston for business and checked out this place for lunch. We order two beers off tap, a fried oyster sandwich, and a fried shrimp sandwich that totaled around $45. The beers were good, however the sandwich bread was very dry and the fried seafood was alittle bland. Still, this place might make a good lunch spot, except order the beers and choose something other than the sandwiches.\n",

The green tea cookies tasted terrible. They are chalky and no flavor. The other cookies also just OK. Nothing to rave about. The breads seem to be better but I do not think it is as good as the bakery in Chinatown. I definitely prefer the bakery in Chinatown much better.\n",

We both liked our dishes although the tarte was on the light side and not a very substantial lunch.  The decaf expresso had a disappointing acidic taste.  I liked the house-made ice cream (salted caramel).  \n",

I could not figure out whether it was the material of the walls but it felt like unrelenting raucousness throughout the meal --- in addition to music (highly superfluous since it could not be heard through the din).  I would give this establishment 4 stars for the main dishes we tried, but unfortunately, the best food is way less appetizing when accompanied by cacophony.\n",

The menus all still read that it is offered but if you try, the counter guy will run out back and check but only come back with sad news for you. Often their specials will sell out and then do not take it off the board. The server then needs to run out back and find out if they have the stuff to make the special so service takes 3 times as long as usual, and it is often slow. \n",

As a vegan, I was excited to try Proper Eats, but the experience was more show stopper than proper.  I got one of the specials, a Quiche, and my girlfriend got the Shepherd's Pie.  Both entrees were $13 and so I was expecting large portions for that price - bummer that they were uber small.  The quiche was not only small but completely dried out, as if it had been reheated several times.  We got the nachos as an app, and they were fine taste-wise, but again super small portion for $8.50.  The biggest mistake was getting dessert to go.  We were charged 25 cents each for to go containers (not a fan of nickel and diming) and when we opened the dessert, it looked like someone ate half the carrot cake, literally.  Once again, the serving size was so small, this \"missing piece\" represented half the portion.  The slice of strawberry pie was 3 bites and totally runny.  I can think of a lot of places I would rather spend $53 (not including gratuity).  There would have to be drastic changes for me to return.\n",

She never returned to our table, and got up maybe three times after the initial plunk-down to deliver a bill to one other table, a couple of beers to another, and a box. Our drinks ran out and we were never asked if we wanted refills, the cook brought us our food, and literally half an hour after my friend and I had emptied our plates (I timed it, because at this point I was getting really annoyed) I finally went up to the counter and a guy from the kitchen rang me up. FOR THE WRONG BILL. I do not know if our lazy waitress wrote the wrong table number on the order slips or what, but I would ordered a small salad and he tried to charge me for a calzone, among other things.

Thanks, lady, for finally proving yourself more useful than a stump. You were four feet away from me the entire night, you could have just leaned slightly over and noticed that our glasses and plates were empty and maybe done your job a little.

Then the food did not show up, so I called them and was basically told they were to busy to call the driver, no apology again. This was not ok so we ordered from Rangoli and went to get our money back. While on the way they called us and said our food was there and we could now have it delivered or pick it up (an hour and a half after I ordered it). No thanks we wanted our money back. That took some convincing also not ok they screwed up. The delivery guy was super nice and apologized so we got the food for free, but seriously what is wrong with the rest of the staff?

The rice had to have been old and reheated because it was shaped from a mold and very dry. The veggies serves alongside where fine but nothing special. My husband order duck and said it was ok but he had certainly had better. We also had a goat cheese salad and it was simple enough that I could make it easily at home, but was pretty good.

The best meat dish (forgive me for forgetting the proper name) was a beef cooked in onions and peppers and garlic, kind of like Ethiopian fajitas.

Perhaps because we were noobs to Ethiopian food, we had to order an extra round of injera to scoop up the food, but were too stuffed to eat the injera bread used as the 'plate' and after sitting underneath the food for the whole meal, it got a soggy consistency that was not very appetizing.   I will admit they gave us enough food, but I thought it was a little pricey for what it was.  It came out to about $18 a person after tax & tip with no alcohol.

What was surprising about the forgetfulness is the fact that the place was not even crowded. Once upon a time this location actually used to serve some pretty appetizing wings. I was super stoked to order the Garlic Parmesan Wings, but when the wings arrived I was like Where is the meat? then when I tasted the wings I was like Where is the flavor? The waitress even made a comment like you barely touched your wings....hmmm I wonder why. Anyone who knows me knows I usually devour wings, there was no devouring going on here.

The waitresses are generally congregated at the end of the bar giggling and chatting.

After about 20 minutes, we saw the waitress put food down on the lane next to ours. We thought it was odd that the couple bowling near us had ordered the exact same food as us, but the menu is pretty small so we did not think much of it. 20 more minutes passed by and my boyfriend commented that he was now almost certain that the food had been put down at the wrong lane, but the couple had started picking at the fries so we were not going to go over and accuse them of eating our food. We tried to search for the waitress but she had somehow disappeared (it was a Sunday afternoon and it was not at all crowded so I am not sure where she was), so we went to the bar in order to get more drinks and to ask the bartender to send the waitress our way if she ever came back. 15 minutes later, our waitress FINALLY reappeared and we asked about our food. She proceeded to walk over, pick up the plate of cold food that had been eaten by other people, and put it down in front of us. I am not super picky about food but that is just a gross thing for a waitress to do. After the whole experience, we asked to speak with a manager. He was very polite, but his answer was, \"Oh, she is new.\" I have worked in a restaurant and I get that sometimes it takes a bit of time to learn the ropes, but it is pure common sense that you do not serve customers cold food that has been partially eaten by strangers.\n",

At 740, I called the restaurant to express my concern that my dinner would be cold; I was hung up on first, then put on hold for 4 minutes, then rushed off with 'yeah, it will be there soon, thanks bye.' \n",

I had ordered honey mustard wings; only one wing had HM sauce, and it was not even covered entirely, the rest were plain. I also ordered and paid for TWO additional sauces for dipping, got neither. And even though I had checked off ketchup for fries, did not get that either, which is a pretty standard Wings Over item to include in a combo meal. I will not even get into the details about the delivery itself. Just be warned that if you have special delivery instructions, they will probably be ignored. \n",

However I do not feel this is a service oriented hotel, e.g. They do not provide an estimate on when the engineers are available whatsoever during the whole process. They also keeps on calling me 6am in the morning because they got my yesterday's breakfasts room service request, nobody put down my credit card when I checked in so I have to got a phone ring at 6am and said there is an urgency I have to read my credit card number to them, 3 days straight. It is the first hotel do not take credit card info when I checked in and it is the first hotel keeps on asking me to fix it, that is the answer I got from the third call. Also there is no room service card from day 2 and I have to get them from the bellman after day 1 at the lobby. \n",

Last time I came here with my boyfriend, and we are both in our younger twenties, and we actually felt like our service was downgraded compared to our fellow neighbors in their 50s. We had to ask for more water at least 3 times, received 2 biscuits that were both corner pieces, and our food was not very warm. I have been here before and had an awesome waitress with impeccable service and tasty food, but I have not had that experience in about a year or so. I used to love their eggplant breakfast but I have just kind of given up on it--and Lucile's in general.\n",
            "I am sad to say that this adorable, super clean and inviting cafe leaves much to be desired in the way of food. We ordered pancake combo. Pancakes were very disappointing. Gooey inside with chewy scorched outside. Bacon was thin and underdone. Eggs were decent but they were just soft scrambled. I will not be coming back no matter how cute this place looks.\n",
            "We were excited to try a another pizza joint in our neighborhood (we did NOT like Conan's!); however, we were unimpressed with the quality of Milano's pizza.  Crust was not homemade; toppings so-so.  We ordered a Margarita and added sausage and black olives on the whole pizza, onions on half.  We received black olives on one half, onions on the other.  But pizza was ready when we got there, and price was fine.  Pizza was still hot when my husband brought it home.  I would rather pay more for high-end pizza (i.e., Cane Rosso's Honey Bastard!).  We may try some other Milano dishes in the future but will order pizza elsewhere.\n",

The dessert we got was good, pretty messy but it was probably the best part of the meal, which is not saying a lot. The staff are friendly and the place is nice, clean and new but that is about it. We do not plan on coming back.\n",

I would expect some sort of amazing sauce with the halibut, since anyone can throw a piece of fish on the grill otherwise. The steak with fresh motzerella was quiet good though but who wants to go to a upscale place where you have to gamble with the menu?\n",

The waiter pushed the veal, I ordered the Godfather, my wife the Florentine veal, we were told fresh, cut in house,.. Very disappointing, veal was tough and very thin cuts, my wife had spinach, tough too and very much looked and tasted like frozen. The high spot was the alfredo fettuccine, nicely done. We got the impression that they would been doing this too long and the cooking and presentation was very uninspired. It was $80 for the two of us w/ salad and a half carafe of house wine.\n",

            "Stopped in for breakfast yesterday and do not think we will be heading back for a long while.  The service was good, but that is about it.  Our pancakes were not fluffy.  They fell apart every time I tried to pick up a piece.  The eggs were a little too \"easy\" on the over easy.  The whites were still liquid and that was a big turnoff.  The bacon was limp and just tasted like fat.  Yuck!  The hash browns were decent and the caramel hot chocolate was pretty good, but neither of those are reasons for me to go back.  We will head to Cracker Barrel in Wrentham next time.  Their pancakes are so much better and it is about the same distance from home.\n",
            "I used to love this place, but I do not know what happened! The last several times I have been here it is just been a waste of time. The main part of the restaurant always seems to be closed so there are just a few tables in the lounge area to sit at, the service is *still* slow an inefficient, and the food just is not worth it anymore. The Happy Hour food menu is half the size it used to be, the mac & cheese is gone from the menu entirely, and the food that is still available is pretty mediocre. I may try again in a year or so to see if they have managed to pull their socks up, but I will not be coming back or recommending it to friends in the meantime.\n",

Unfortunately none of them passed the grocery store test. \n",

Well -- if I can make a better baked good by going to a grocery store, buying some cake mix and throwing it in the oven for 45 minutes then you fail the grocery store test.

I walked in, there were not any other guests, there were 5 people behind the counter. No one said a word to me. One was working on something toward the back and another counting money at the register. That left 3 other people. Not one acknowledged my presence at the counter. I am not saying that everyone needed to stop and pay attention to me. But some sort of acknowledgement, is important to me. \n",

            "While we have previously had positive experiences at this restaurant, most recent experience was extremely disappointing. The service was very poor, even by Portland standards. Server was very inattentive, poor attitude, and poor menu knowledge. Got the short ribs which was way too salty and way too fatty. $100 meal for two people and we left still feeling hungry. Had to wait over an hour for food to arrive, and they were not very busy that night. Definitely will not return. Save your money for one of the other much better restaurants. The atmosphere is nice, and is the only redeeming quality at this place.\n",
            "I love Indian food. This place is not Indian food. I am really not that picky. I love Americanized Indian food as much as the next college student, but there was absolute nothing in the buffet here that I liked. I really do not understand why this place is so popular. It is the most boring food I have ever had the misfortune of sampling. Oh well. It is the Luby's of Indian restaurants. \n",

My husband's burger with \"crispy friend jalapeños\" had one crispy jalapeño...the rest had no breading and no crisp.  The service was among the worst.  Their cider tasted like Boone's Farm taking me back to my underage drinking days.  No sign of a manager. Did I mention the service sucked?  Do yourself a favor and order to-go if you absolutely must try their food.  Their beer was not that great anyway.\n",

            "My husband and I were on the Disney Dining Plan (DDP) so we got dessert which we would normally never try in a place like this.  The chocolate cake was edible, but Little Debbie does a better job.  It is a rare dessert that looks better than it tastes.  The frozen lemonade was pre-packaged, and was refreshing if not entirely necessary. \n",

I ordered the entrees in advance soon as we got the appetizers but the entrees also took 45 minutes.   Some of the entrees were super rich and had a tad extra salt and then the chef would throw in a random ingredient to make it taste sweet. The last thing a foodie needs is to be confused by there dish and thus not enjoy it.  Very underwhelming experience and with the increased prices to make up for the lack of attendance... perhaps they need a new chef or have more people cooking in the kitchen because it seemed like there was only one.  Never coming again.\n",
            "If you are a doughnut lover like me, this is not the place for you. Without the icing or sweets, the dough itself is tastless and very heavy. Coffee is not good too. I guess that is what you get when you go to a vegan place.\n",

I got the tonkatsu broth, and it tasted like it came from an instant ramen package. The only thing that was up to par was the sauce. I have eaten at many other Shabu Shabu places, and this place offers an extremely mediocre experience for a hefty price.\n",
            "I honestly expected a lot more. It was just OK. The server kept saying \"cool-beans\", which always drives me nuts and spoke so fast, I could not understand the specials even after asking him to repeat. The food was not anything special, and I asked for what they are known for. The chickpeas in my soup were under-cooked and the taste just did not earn the price. Bummer.\n",
            "Nice Asian restaurant inside Disney Animal Kingdom. Full bar. I had the wonton soup which was OK, but could have had more flavor. The dim sum basket was barely warm and one might say it was actually cold. I sat at the bar and would have thought that my food would have been hot considering that it was not busy. This is not my first time here but it is my first review. I hope the next time I come back it will be better.\n",
            "I was excited to try a new restaurant in my barrio. I think it was expensive in relation to what we got in terms of quality. The ingredients were sub par. No local, not organic or fresh.

No. Do I see this place lasting? No. I wish it was a Little Big Burger instead.\n",
            "I really do not know what the hype is all about here. Sure, the ramen is a reasonable price. But it is not all that good. The noodles seem to be out of a package, and while the chicken broth is thick, it is not especially flavorful. The veggie broth is really, really thin and tasteless. The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.\n",

Also - a big pet peeve is that it is cash only, but it is not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I did not ask when I sat down, partly because there is one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it is posted somewhere!\n",

My friend and I paid in part cash ($14) and the rest on card.  When we got the receipt back, $8 in cash was taken off and the rest charged to my card.  We are still stumped as to how you get $8 dollars from 2 fives and 4 dollar bills.  The waitress did admit I was right after looking the drawer and went off. She came back with an updated receipt, which was correct, but barely apologized.  You cannot short someone $6 or 60 cents and be like 'have a good one'.  \n",

Then when I was talking to the manager at the end, he said they could have done a Coke float because they have the bottles. He blamed it all on being so busy.  I do not know if their coke machine is extra special but I know from working places with soda machines you do not have to wait for that stuff to be delivered- you can go get it.  You can also trade with another place.\n",

We sat at the bar and could see all the food hit the prep window.  Our food sat there for a couple minutes, which I get is not a huge deal, but they were not busy and several people passed by the window with the food sitting there.  Finally the one guy who was running food got to our order.  Fries were barely warm.  We were not a fan of the ketchup or BBQ, which we were charged for without being told.\n",

The meats were are quite fatty and over seasoned, so it made everything really salty. The fried food selection was pretty good, and the chicken wings were at least decent.\n",
            "I was torn about this review- on the one hand this is a decent bar in Boston, not super expensive and pretty casual, but on the other hand there SUCH a bad attitude among the staff that it is ridiculous. I have been here MANY times and EVERY time the bouncers have been jerks and made a big deal about the tiniest thing. Most recently the bouncer kicked out a friend of mine in the middle of the day time because he swore that my friend did not tell him that he was leaving for a minute to find another friend of ours. When my friend came back the bouncer insisted that he had been gone for too long (10 mins) and that meant he must have gone to another bar. My friend was merely waiting outside for another friend, in plain sight of the bouncer, so this accusation did not sit well. Overall our whole group got sassed and kicked out over this ridiculous insignificant episode. That seems pretty harsh considering we were there in the middle of the day just hanging out as opposed to some crazy middle of the night story.

            "I and a guest first visited  Mangieri's in July 2010 at the new location at Escarpment Village near Circle C ranch. At the time, I noted that - in moving from the prior location a few doors down - Mangieri's is bigger overall, but seemed smaller in the restaurant area. They did away with the ordering counter and self service drink area and went to hostess and sit down then order.  Very noisy inside.  Way too noisy to enjoy our food so we never placed an order.  We decided to return when the weather cooled down so we could try eating in the outdoor dining area. \n",

The meatball pizza seemed to have ground beef rather than true meatball and was also very bland and uninspiring.  The outdoor dining area itself  was fine, but the pizza was uninspiring and not worth the money or the time it took to order and eat it.

Instead of them giving her the extras she ordered in a separate bowl to make everything right....

No host at the door. We literally sat ourselves at a dining table. Waiter eventually came over and we decided to order our drinks and food at the same time. 40 minutes later, no drinks nor food.

Only one small piece of edible duck and no veggies. The other dish was okay m, forgot what it was called, but t was like vegetable pho and was okay. The prices were high for what we were served.

And apparently their other location was on Manor Road which is a little too far for me to go for Tex-Mex or Mexican since I live on the south-side which has one of the highest Tex-Mex restaurants ratios per capita utterly negating any need to travel north of the river for such foods.  Where was I?  Oh yeah, El Chile.  So El Chile is where La Reyna used to be on South First and I have no idea how La Reyna stayed open for so long (food no bueno) and all the new eateries in the area finally killed them.  But it did.  And since my memory was foggy and I had not been to the new location, I figured it would be a good time to go test them out.\n",

            "For some reason I thought El Chile was a more of a healthy take on our T-M faves but that is not quite right.  On the spectrum of traditional Tex-Mex versus gringo/southwest/healthy style Tex-Mex, El Chile is actually somewhere in the middle.  They have black beans but no grilled veggies (that I saw, maybe they do, but I did not see them on the menu and did not want to be 'that girl' and ask); they have that white rice instead of Spanish rice but no salad entrees (although I see a picture here of someone is salad, maybe that is only on the dinner menu).  Garridos and La Condessa downtown are the two restaurants that are on the far side of the \"healthy\" Tex-Mex spectrum, both offering grilled veggies and salad entrees.  So if that is what you are looking for, go there.  \n",

            "Now, do not get me wrong, I will throw down on some regular Tex-Mex, but it just so happened I had been in the Valley last week and eaten Tex-Mex for almost every meal so was in the mood for something lighter.  Not finding anything super light at El Chile, I order the next healthiest thing: fried fish (duh).  The food was decent, but under seasoned, and no real evidence of their namesake, chile, anywhere.  Not sure who they are trying to appeal to--maybe people who cannot wait for a table at Polvo's and for whom La Mexicana is too authentic and who do not know about Curra's?  El Chile's food falls under the category of \"just because you put it in a tortilla does not make it a taco\" except here it is like, just because you had the name written in Spanish on the menu, does not mean it is Mexican or Tex-Mex.  It is just food with some black beans and white rice.\n",

            "The service is also strange.  We had a total of three different waitresses throughout lunch and they were hovering a little too much and would each ask us the same question the other one or two had asked the minute before.  Remember at Poncho's, where you just raised the flag when you needed your server?  A system like that would have been much less distracting.  They asked repeatedly if we were done, when we still had food on our plates and then we said yes, they took his plate and left mine for several minutes.  When they finally got my plate, she put another table's dirty salsa bowls on my plate before picking it up off the table.  Kind of gross.\n",

I assumed that whoever was too lazy to walk to the other side of the table where my date was sitting and that is why they dropped the check on the far end of the table, but when they brought the check back, after he would put his card in, and dropped it in front of me again, maybe they were really assuming I was paying and not him?  I am not sure who was more put off by that series of events, me or my date, but it was pretty off-putting to say the least.  That paired with the food and the weird forced flavored iced tea (yes, it is black currant but tastes like peach and they do not tell you it is flavored when you order it) means I probably will not be back here for lunch.  I may consider happy hour though: maybe they could get nachos and drinks right?  The quac was a pretty weak, so maybe not.\n",

If I had driven past it on any other day, I either would not have noticed it or just assumed it was something similar to a Ted's Montana Grill.  Inside was...basic.  I guess I was hoping for a little darker lighting and a feel of an old steakhouse.  I mean, you are getting ready to taste/eat wild game, which for most is a first.  The girl who seated our party took away my place setting (I parked and let the other 4 in my group go ahead...the reservation was for 5), so right off the bat, you could tell people were confused.  Our waiter was energetic and knowledgeable about the menu, but he was clearly the only seasoned waiter there, because I caught him reaming out one of the other waiters for something and he was bouncing all over the place, which was not overly crowded.  Two couples were seated behind our table and no one attended to them for at least 15 minutes, which made me uncomfortable hearing them complain the whole time.  Our food came out with relative ease and no problems, but our waiter forgot the bottle of wine we ordered with dinner...oops.  Kind of a big deal.  He was nice enough to honor the Scoutmob deal and let me keep it for another return visit as an apology.  \n",

Maybe this place will succeed simply because they are serving something different and people will want to enjoy the novelty for a bit, but I do not see it sustaining too long before the service and atmosphere ruin the concept for patrons.  I will go back and use the Scoutmob deal again, but only because of that.  If I did not have it to use again, I definitely would not go back.\n",

Their placard for \"Best Takeout\" for 1995 all made sense when I had to ask for water, napkins, and  sauce, and waited for the bill--they only show up to bring out your food (and maybe, a menu), all done with a stoic expression.

I was here for a friend's birthday party and we had the loft area of the restaurant which made it a nice area to chill and hang out except for the fact that the washrooms are located in that area.  The service was quick, friendly and organized.  The décor can do with an upgrade but the place is not dingy or anything.  I was pleasantly surprised that they served Ciroc (my favorite vodka to date) but that pretty much was the end of my pleasure with the gastronomic appeal of Lickerish.  I ordered their pistachio encrusted brie with strawberry sauce and it tasted horribly of old cheese that had absorbed all the fridge smells into it.  I never bothered to order another dish and only took two bites of my appie and did not touch it again.  I did sample a friend's bruschetta which was good but how can you really go wrong with bruschetta.  Another girlfriend had ordered their sliders and was quite happy with it.  It was old school hip-hop night and I felt like I was back at one of my high school dances again which is fun in a nostalgic kind of way.  Overall, I would not recommend Lickerish but if you end up there, stick to drinks and by-pass the food, dance and be merry!\n",

Drinks were good, Moscow mule not served in a copper cup (that is just being picky). Espresso martinis were good. The decor reminded me of the lobby of a holiday inn express. Server was in training but really good.\n",

Place was pretty dead, granted it was a Monday night, but it is a holiday week and I remember thinking there should have been more than one other party at dinner time.  Service was really good, waiter explained the menu very well, made a few draft beer recommendations and left us alone to decide.  Wife ordered the Cesar Salad - nothing special.  We then ordered the garlic bread sticks and were told 15 mins later that they were out of bread sticks but were making them with toast instead.  It was OK, reminded me of the TX toast you see all over the place.  I ordered a individual size pizza - really did not have anything about it that was great.  It was just ok at best.\n",

I did not know you could mess up a skirt steak, i just throw them on the grill and forget about them.  The side dishes were not bad, but they were nothing special at all, similar to frozen vegetable packages you find at Trader Joe's and throw in the microwave.

The coffee takes a few minutes to make so it is not like you move as fast through the line as you would if this was fast food. It seriously took about a few minutes to get in and out.

The chicken parm was decent, the polenta and braised beef was a big shlop i could barely eat. The place was dead, but we were placed in the back corner because the nearby tables had not been cleared. And stayed that way for the majority of our dinner. Our bread was cold, crumbly, and just blah. Not the usual warm, fresh rolls you would usually get. I suggest management takes a hard look at this Bertucci's and ensures that it is brought up to par with the rest. As of now, we will consider it a bootleg Bertucci's and likely will not be back.\n",

Very tasteless and hardly any clam. I also had the bleu cheese balsamic salad which was good but nothing great. Overall the food was disappointing and I think we were all shocked to realize that Beaches does not do anything special for someone is birthday. He just got a fake lei on his neck. I have never been to a restaurant that does not sing happy birthday or have a dessert for the birthday boy. So strange. I would not go back.\n",

In fact, the server brought out the main entrees and was about to put them on the table with the empty salad and appetizer plates until we asked that the dirty dishes be removed first to make room for the next course.\n",
            "3. An empanada was ordered by three of us and all three empanadas came on the same small plate with only one small chimichurri sauce container.  Server had to go back and get them put on separate plates each with their own chicichurri sauce.\n",
            "4. The person who ordered the salmon (nightly special) received some other fish, not salmon.  \n",
            "5. The salmon/fish was supposed to come with green beans and mashed potatoes and we ordered asparagus to substitute for the mashed potatoes.  The dish came with 2 orders of green beans, no asparagus.\n",
            "6. When the waitress appeared and we told her the fish was not salmon, it took her quite a while to return and tell us that another fish had been substituted.  No offer was made to change the order but she did ask if it was okay.  Later she comped a glass a wine for the mistake.\n",
            "7. After the meal, one coffee and one dessert were ordered.  The coffee arrived.  Time passed.  The coffee was finished.  When the waitress came by, the person asked for more coffee and asked about the dessert.  The response by the waitress was \"the dessert has to come out of the kitchen.\"  Very irritated and unpleasant attitude.  \n",
            "8.  When she returned, she said, \"Pass me the coffee cup\"-- the person wanting coffee was across the table of 4.  No \"please\", or \"would you please\", etc. Why not just walk to the other side of the table in order to refill the coffee.\n",
            "\n",
            "The attitude of the server and the poor service quite frankly ruined the entire dining experience for us although the food was good.  \n",

            "This dining experience actually occurred a couple of months ago.  I wrote it up thinking I should perhaps share it with the owner of the restaurant, but did not because I thought it might just have been a bad day for Melissa and the kitchen.  We went again this past week.  Same waitperson.  Same unpleasant, unfriendly attitude.  During our time there, she was at the bar engaged in conversation with two people there and we could not even get her attention to order dessert.  We probably will not return to this place--service does make a difference.\n",
            "This Hooters is okay......the bathrooms needed some repairs and updating , they are in Midtown Atlanta so parking is on the street, the food itself was just simple bar food but the wings were over saucy and the bones crumbled when I tried to eat some of the wings. The fries were good , fried pickles and sauce were good but the price for just these items and a beer was $80 so I think this restaurant is very over priced and a little  . The staff are friendly enough but they just seemed like they wanted to get done and leave and the atmosphere was very blah.\n",
            "Five guys is a better burger joint.  The fries were not good the Lockhart burger was not good either. The onions on the burger tasted like an onion with oil.  The bun was the best part of the meal and that is not saying much.\n",

She tried hers and made a face as if something was wrong.  We both agreed the drinks did not taste very good, but the milk theory was no longer valid.  I really tried to be open-minded and continued to take a couple sips.  I even tried my wife's, and it had the exact same sour taste, so I guess it was the coffee that had the odd flavor.  We both ended up dumping out our drinks.\n",

Until recently, some coffee I had order at a Denny's at an Ohio truckstop was the benchmark for most disgusting cup encountered, but this was a new low.  The best way I can describe the taste is to say that it tasted like spoiled milk filtered through an old dirty gym sock.\n",

            "Food is okay, variety of items lack flavor or lacked key ingredients; some items with meat or a filling seemed like they went extra frugal on those key ingredients.  Debated between 1 & 2 stars; 2 stars only because of no MESSAGE and a few items are okay.\n",

Both our meals (Peanut&Ginger Tofu and BBQ Tempeh) were bland and uninspired - most people could do better at home. \n",
            "Plus, the space itself is rather uninviting (I refer you to Alex S's review, which makes for an excellent representation of what I would have a hard time trying to put into words).\n",
            "If you are in the area you might want to give this a try, but I do not think it is worth going the extra mile.\n",
            "Overall food is pretty good.  Quality of seasoning for some dishes (beef salad, Gai Pad Grapow) is better than other offerings in the neighborhood like Take Thai home or Bao Thai. However the portion sizes for mains are not enough if you are moderately hungry. Add to this that some dishes (panang curry I am looking at you!) are actually lower quality than cheaper options and you are left feeling a bit had. Bill for myself and my partner came to $50. This was for 2 draft beers (delicious!) and 2 \"mains\" (beef salad and panang curry). I was still so hungry that I got 2 slices from pizza garden. With really awesome places in the neighborhood that deliver better food and price (Mr. Red's, Laska King, Basho Cafe) it is hard to recommend Kin Kao. It is even harder when I consider what $50 would have bought at Mescal or Kishimoto just down the street. Feels like there going for a Maenam or Pok Pok vibe but failing at it. On top of this the lighting inside is essentially fancy florescent and it is so sparse it feels like a waiting room. North Commercial Drive could use more adventurous restaurants but what it definitely does not need is over priced underachievers. I will say that when I went for the soft opening that the food and the prices were both better. I know they are new so I hope they figure it out.\n",
            "They have good Pizza I will give them that.  But their customer service is poor at best.  They do not consider any special requests. What you see is what you get.  They run out of things constantly and the management is not willing to consider any substitutions.  When they do run out of things and call you twenty minuets after you have placed your order to tell you they have run out, they are not willing to offer any substitutions or compensation.  The Manger was very unpleasant on the phone as well.\n",
            "We have given Grapevine a couple chances in the name of supporting local business.  Service was spotty the first time, we chalked it up to the recent opening. The second time we watched two \"hostesses\" and several other employees hang around behind the front desk while we waited 15 minutes for bottled beers and another 10 for a chili dip appetizer that arrived cold. Have these folks act as expediters and our experience improves dramatically. Our server (the bartender) worked his butt off so extra star for him.\n",
            "The service is fast -- but that is because I suspect the food was precooked hours earlier (i.e., they served me leftovers).  \n",

            "But for that fix a few times a year, it is serviceable.\n",
            "The beer was really good (fresh and a good selection) however the food and service was mediocre. Our server was nice.. When she was around. It was not busy but we did hear a server say they were short staffed. I ordered the lobster quesadilla which was tiny and has hardly any lobster. I actually had to open each piece to see how much  was in there ( much less than a tablespoon in each slice (4). Each piece was 2 bites! I honestly do not expect much in terms of food portions but this was not acceptable. The fried seafood combo meal ( around $30 a plate) came with a small portion cup of tarter sauce and no one ever came back after dropping it off to check on us or see if we needed anything else (we clearly needed more than 1 oz of tarter sauce)! The seafood was good, however the plating is a little odd. The fries and onion rings were sitting under all the seafood, collecting all of the grease. When you got to them they were slimy  and sitting in a pool of oil. I just wish after spending $100 on a meal for 2 that I did not come home hungry and annoyed at the lack of service. Plus thirsty since no one ever came to check on us and make sure we were ok with everything.. never even offered waters. Also, my husband's plate was dirty so he had to eat his oysters off of the main dish it was served on. All in all, I would not return. Not worth your money. Going out to eat should not leave you feeling annoyed afterward!\n",
            "This location seems to be one asian buffet after another. Some good, some bad. As Sakura I can say that the new dining room layout is nicer than the previous and very spacious. Also the inclusion of sushi is very welcome providing a mix of nigiri sushi, rolls and sashimi. Staff was prompt and friendly, food stations and dining room looked clean and well maintained. Chocolate mousse dessert cup were good. \n",
            "\n",
            "The food overall was lower quality I AM GOING TO than a typical Asian buffet and the aforementioned sushi was pretty dry, even for a buffet. I avoided most of the meat dishes on the line because they did not look great and hey, there was sushi to be had. Cutting beef/chicken/cooked salmon out I found the remaining selection of food pretty limited. \n",
            "\n",
            "As others said though, the killing blow for Sakura is that absurd price! Even with the \"holiday special\" they want $15 a head for dinner and all day Sunday. The place was dead when we went and for good reason. I honestly cannot say that Sakura tasted any better than Supreme buffet on the west side despite costing almost twice as much (and losing the hibachi grill + larger selection).\n",

            "If they cost $10 it would be another story, but as is Sakura just is not worth it.\n",
            "This place is underwhelming. Their gimmick to have both sushi and burger options might work if it had not been for the over-packed menu. Hundreds of items, combinations and innovations (tuna and avocado-tini, or burger-sushi roll) creates confusion. You have to take at least 20 minutes to go over the menu and take it in. \n",
            "Service on a Sunday lunch was too slow- kids dishes arrived, but our order took about 40 (!!) minutes, by that time the kids were done and bored. They tried to explain it as a change of menu kitchen problem, or that they had to accommodate too many special requests, which does not sound right for a chain- what changed so drastically today that the kitchen was so overwhelmed? Combinations and special requests is what they pride on, so what happened here? They ended up taking some items off our bill, but it is impossible to spend almost 2 hours for lunch with young ones.\n",
            "And finally- the food. Innovative-yes, but that is not enough for us to come back. Sushi was just ok, burger had so much toppings and sides (the bento box option) going on that you could barely know what you are eating, plus a burger should be bigger to get the right flavors and cooking.\n",

After parking you wander through clouds of cement dust and exhaust, trying to get your bearings, hoping for a sign on how to get out. By the time you get to the theater you are half asphyxiated, disoriented, dizzy... You stand in the fancy lobby while lordly hipsters float by with craft beers or whatever, and you have no idea where you are supposed to go. The only place with staff appears to be some kind of bar. After waiting for a while, eventually someone behind the bar will point to a little touch screen thingy that does not exactly portray itself as a ticket booth. There are still some positives, but I miss the old Alamo South. This place makes me feel like I am in Houston.\n",
            "The prices left a bad taste in my mouth. I ordered one of the virgin drinks and ask for a little gin in it. I fully expected to pay more by adding alcohol. The virgin drink was $8 and they charged me TEN (!!!) additional to add the gin. This is highway robbery considering that the average price of the other cocktails on the menu was $14-$16. Very nice bar and the food looked great, but I cannot bring myself to give them any more of my business after this experience.\n",

My coffee was done a full  -10- minutes, at least, after my \"date's\" coffee was done, who was literally behind me in line. The cashier guy even came out from BEHIND THE COUNTER to serve it to him while we were sitting at our table, with a big smile, completely ignoring my presence with no eye contact and like they were having a secret laugh. But when mine was done after his? I heard a loud and annoyed yell of my name while he just stood there doing nothing behind the counter. The place was not even busy; there is just a few people sitting at tables. He just stuck my coffee down right next to him on the counter, without so much of a thought. WTF? Is that misogyny, sexism, classism, or what all rolled-into-one? It was a pain in the ass to balance this overfull mug (which at least they gave me enough for that $3.50 decaf coffee water) with the tea-tray to my table, and I was seriously annoyed that he was being so blatantly preferential to my \"date\".

And, despite it all, the decaf water coffee with hemp milk was not bad, for what it was. I did like how they served it in a mug, even though it was such a pain in the ass to carry back. But I seriously am debating whether I ever want to come back here again -- I can easily spend $3.50 on a bigger, better coffee with nicer customer service elsewhere, big open space or no.\n",

Since I live less than 1.5 miles from this relatively new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.

As a small side complaint , the decor of the restaurant was a bit over the top on the tacky side with lots of neon and seemed very cold with too much echo because the walls are covered in various marble tiles and cut glass mirrors.  It reminds me of some of the over-the-top diners in Long Island.  The decor and lighting was a bit distracting during the meal, and the lighting was definitely too bright for an evening dinner.  This is not the place for an intimate or romantic dinner.  It would be great for a large group, I suppose, especially if you are into watching TV from almost every angle while you eat.\n",

The spanakopita, which has always been a favorite of mine, was not good at all and was far too greasy with not enough dough for the copious amount of spinach.  The flavor was very bland and tasted like they skimped on ingredients or either it was just a pre-made frozen dish.  I have had better spanakopita from the grocery store freezer if that tells you how disappointing this dish was...especially since most Greek restaurants do a good job with this popular dish.  \n",

Their Taramousalata was just as bland as what you would find at the grocery store in a jar and did not taste at all like it was made on the premises.  Furthermore, I would consider their pita bread to be slightly below average in taste and texture for a Greek restaurant.  It was not any better than what you would find at the local grocery store full of preservatives. \n",

I love onion, but I had to take apart the wrap to remove a giant handful... and more and more shredded onion kept coming out!  it was just too much!  There was also WAY too much lettuce.  This restaurant does what many others do...which is load up the wraps and sandwiches with the cheaper stuff like lettuce, sauce and onion and skimp on the tomato, feta, olives, meat, etc.  We removed half of the lettuce and half of the onion which brought the wrap down to a normal and manageable size to eat.  However, that left us with very little else in the wrap since the meat, feta, etc was in such small quantity.  This is definitely a case where bigger was not better.  My sister said the flavor of her gyro meat was good, though.  \n",

The Greek potatoes were definitely better than the fries, but tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  The texture of oven roasted potatoes should be soft but not mushy, sticky and wet.  The lemony flavor was pretty good, but they just did not taste fresh at all...the taste was more akin to \"microwaved leftovers\" since they were overcooked and reheated.\n",

Perhaps their other dishes are wonderful, but it is hard for me to trust a kitchen that does not bother to put any pride in the french fries or roasted potatoes they serve since they accompany almost every dish.  I felt the kitchen skimped on ingredients and did not produce dishes that made full use of all the wonderful seasonings you find with most Greek and Mediterranean restaurants.  In my opinion, this is more like the \"Waffle House\" of Greek restaurants...bright, loud and cheesy atmosphere with food that you should not expect to be chef quality.\n",

When dining on the patio with friends during Happy Hour (so way BEFORE the busy dinner rush!) Service was extremely slow. Waited upon everything from utensils to requests for condiments. In the middle of our meal, a busboy drags out two tall open can containers of garbage and empty liquor bottles out the customer bar entrance across the patio, stopping right next to our table to I guess get a better grip? Proceeds to drag them past the other dining guests leaving a snail trail of garbage goo along the path out the gate.  Horrified, I immediately went inside to ask for a manager.  The manager came to the table and when I described what happened and pointed out the garbage trail.. All he could say was I am so sorry, I will have a word with the employee! HUH?? What about apologizing to the other 3 tables of guests on your patio? What about some sort of comp? A free glass of wine? Anything?? We finished our dinner to the entertainment of the next employee cleaning the patio of the garbage trail with a long scrubber brush.. Then had to send the waitress back to correct the tickets that did not reflect the Happy hour pricing or Member Points.. *Sigh* Cooper's Hawk you need to bring your service and management up a few hundred notches to match the food & wine. :(\n",

I am going to be honest. I am not much of a fast food person, but I would have rather had tacos from Taco Bell.. the meat tasted disgusting and the farthest thing from appetizing. Neither of us could finish our meals.2 Stars from us.. not thrilled.\n",

I had the Coast Signature Burger because I was attracted to the lobster poutine side.  The burger was not bad, not great, but the lobster poutine made me sad.  No bisque gravy, just a bit of lobster, so very meh.  I know it is just a side portion but if that is a mini version of the appetizer I would not order that appetizer.  My husband wound up with the worst dish.  At first he wanted to order the beef tenderloin but opted for red snapper instead as Coast is a seafood resto.  When the snapper came there was no wow in the presentation.  Just a piece of grilled fish on plain white beans.  The disappointment was showing clearly on his face when he was eating the dish.  The snapper had no flavor, the bean ragout was dry as well.  Overall dry dish.  Will not order that or any of the seafood dishes ever again.  And just to erase the bad experience of that dish we ordered the sushi feature.  Now that was a winner.  Should have gone with that in the first place.  Service was fast and efficient, Tina our server handled her guests with aplomb.  I guess people really do not go to Glowbal restaurants for the food, but that really makes me wish I should have used my hard earned opentable cheque elsewhere.\n",

The gimmick here is the hot stone you can cook your raw beef on: 6 one-inch squares to share. Sushi is good but way overpriced.

You see, it is actually a physical workout to stir-fry rice, and if you cannot taste the labor of love that went into it, it is probably not good fried rice.

Then when I asked to check out with my mother she ignored us and started texting and laughing on her phone. I tried to get her full name but she just kind of walked away. I went to the front desk area and told someone but it kind of got brushed off. No one their is really very friendly and the people in the lobby are always trying to talk to me about the timeshare. Food is normal mall food court food. The outside is pretty and the ferris wheel is nice at certain times of the day which I will come back to ride. I just will not be buying anything from the store at the end.\n",

Had a cute little bar upstairs to wait in, so that was a plus.  The food would have been alright, but it was all served cold.  My friend had the chicken enchilada soup, and I tried the mini tacos.  I can see where the carnitas might be really good, but it being served in a cold tortilla ruined it for me.  I would give this place 4 or 5 stars as a place to grab a cocktail before a show at Stubb's.\n",

My boyfriend and I ordered what we order about 90% of the time (burgers) and were both very disappointed.  I immediately remarked that my burger tasted like a burger from elementary school BBQ day - dry and charcoal-tasting.  My boyfriend showed me that his burger bun was dry and crumbling away, and by the middle of his burger there was hardly any bun left in his hands.  He also commented that his fries were cold, which made me think that our burgers may have been fine initially but left under the food warmer for too long before being brought out.\n",

            "Breakfast Club Altamonte falls short across the board. You want to think its a cafe with fresh prepared dishes that would be better than Denny's, But it is not. It is a mediocre greasy spoon at best. Sure there are some crepe options and fancy sounding hipster breakfast plates, but it is just below average. The food is plain. Meats in the crepes are like diced lunch meats and nothing at our table was served hot. Even though the place was near empty and the food came quick, it was merely warm. The bacon was cold and the crepe was just above room temp. It tasted like it could have been so much better if only someone put the tiniest bit of effort in. \n",
            "The front windows are dirty and streaked and the whole place looks like it needs a good clean. Not just the half assed wipe down that employees think is cleaning. Then there is the ambience. Expecting an adult breakfast experience, the radio is tuned to a local rock station at just enough volume to annoy. I like classic rock, but hearing Rock You Like a Hurricane at conversation level will trying to enjoy what should have been a nice breakfast was frustrating. In fact frustrating is the best way I can describe dining at BCA. Judging by the empty dining room, I may not be alone in this assessment. In my view BCA seems to be operated under a truck stop style of restaurant management.\n",

            "Having had a chance to see a film in one of the newly renovated theaters, I think an update is merited. First, there are some physical changes to the lobby, ones good or bad depending on whether you prefer billiards or comfy couches. The main lobby area is now essentially a full-on bar (though one that serves food), with all tables and chairs at barstool height. Two pool tables have replaced the hubs of couch seating that used to be in the center of the room. I am unclear on the reason for this change, but I assume it has something to do with iPic wanting the place to be a \"destination\" even for non-filmgoers.\n",
            "\n",
            "A brand-new addition to the lobby is automated kiosks for buying tickets or picking up ones bought online. Again, whether this is good or bad depends on your tastes. It is certainly less \"luxurious\" to use a kiosk, but OTOH tonight there were four people in line at the counter, so I was able to pick up my ticket immediately via kiosk. By The Way by \"brand-new\" I mean literally: the installer was there when I got my ticket, and apparently I was the very first person besides him to use the system. (Note: only one of the four kiosks is, as of this moment, functional, but I assume the others will be shortly.) By The Way I concur with other Yelpers that iPic's Web site totally sucks, though it is actually marginally better than Gold Class's old one was.\n",
            "\n",
            "New theater layout: two thumbs straight down. I am one of those guys who likes to sit at exact eye level with the middle of the screen, and at most theaters that involves sitting either in the back row or near it. At the old Gold Class theaters, the back row was perfect for this. However, iPic appears to have not only scooted the \"premium plus\" section quite a bit back, but also quite a bit upwards: in the top row I was literally looking down at the screen. Not craning, mind you, and it was not so bad once I reclined my seat, but still, the best views are now around the middle-to-bottom part of the section.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Premium\" seats: my instinct that they would be way too close to the screen was mostly on target. In my theater at least -- and I believe they are all the same size -- there are three \"premium\" rows at the front. I think watching from the back row of the three would be okay, but the other two would be just as bad as getting stuck in the front rows at the Drafthouse. As for the seats themselves: while certainly larger than a standard movie seat, and more akin to a lounge chair, each pair has a faux-wood tray uncomfortably perched in the middle -- and unless they swing forward, which I am admittedly unsure of (I took a peek at the seats but did not sit there), they actually *eliminate* much of the armrests! I cannot imagine how that would be comfortable, frankly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Service: same complaints as before, but it is arguably gotten worse. I am still befuddled by the elimination of the call buttons. When I asked my server what I should do if I wanted a refill of either water or drink, she said I should perch my empty glass on the aisle-facing arm. (Do note that this involves putting a glass probably with moisture on its bottom on a suede-cushioned surface.) This worked fine until she brought me the bill barely halfway into the film. Now, I know I happened to see the late show, and I am sure she wanted to call it a night, but I am sorry: this are not Chili's -- or even the Drafthouse, for that matter -- and if you have customers who have paid up to $30 a ticket wanting food and drink up until the very end of the flick, then you need to damn well *serve* up until the very end of the flick. I almost chopped them to a one-star rating on this basis alone, but am keeping them at two for all the reasons stated in my last review.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway ... the whole thing still seems very much like a work in progress (*still*), from the ticket kiosks to the convoluted serving issues, all of which stemmed from servers who seemed to be rank amateurs (one guy - not my server, but the one serving most people near me - insisted on carding literally everyone who ordered anything alcoholic, even people clearly in their 30s and possibly 40s). Honestly, I would not have even gone if iPic had not sent me a coupon for a free ticket (premium seat, that is, or an upgrade to premium plus for $7 more, which I ended up doing). This was the only instance I have seen -- and, possibly, will ever see -- of iPic being an actual bargain: I got to see the new \"Transformers\" movie on opening night, in a reclining chaise, for a mere $7 with no wait in line (by the way iPic apparently does not add a surcharge for 3-D films, which is one of the reasons I am keeping them at two stars).\n",

There was cream flavored slop, potato based slop, etc.  You get the picture.  I felt like I was eating at some military emcampment where the mess sergeant just kind of threw every thing together, let it cook together for an hour, and then rang the dinner bell.  You do not eat here, you graze.  Even though they only charged like $6 for the buffett, I am pretty sure they still made $5.50 in profit on my meal as the ingredients could not have cost more than a pittance.

The bar looked awesome and my first thought walking in was \"wow, how cozy!\"  I ordered the steak tips and they offered two sides. I chose a side salad and waffle fries. There was an up charge of $3 for the fries but i did not mind because i love waffle fries. When the food came out that is when they lost me..... The (supposedly) 1lb of steak tips were on top on the side salad and the waffle fries came on another side plate. I asked the bartender for a plate and she passed me a tiny appetizer plate. I explained i needed a dinner plate so i can put my steak stips and fries on one plate. I take my first bite of steak and its cold! I had them warm them up.  The waffle fries had no spice on them! Now i could put all that aside if the steak was lip smacking good, but no! The steak was cut up small, lacked marinade flavor, and every bite was elastically like each piece i swallowed i had no chance of it being chewed properly. I definitely recommend they look into a better quality meat.  On the upside, i really liked the side salad! They use a spring mix and it was really fresh! Unfortunately i just did not think my meal was a $20 quality. If you miss the mark on food then it really does not matter how many tv's you have.\n",

When I finally called him out when he brought our cards he finally changed his tune and said \"oh well I am sorry if there is been any confusion\". This guy is a jerk.\n",

            "I had a good sandwich and French onion soup but I would not say that it was great. Its not a place to eat if you are looking for low calorie healthy meals . The croissants and other pastries looked good but I did not try them. The coffee was not fresh which was a little surprising because it was only 11:30  am. This place is kind of like a movie that you want to see but really can just wait until the DVD is made. I would recommend going but only if you are in the neighborhood. Not that impressed and feel a little bit mislead from the other yelp reviews.\n",
            "Ok this place is located on City Walk in Universal Park. After leaving the park my group of 10 decided to stop here for dinner. Their first strike is they assured us that it would be a 20 minute wait, no more than 30. Well it took them on hour to seat us and what makes it worse is when we got upstairs there were at least 5 large tables big enough for my party all nice and clean with no one sitting at them. Everyone at the table pretty much had something different and nobody really raved about anything. Everyone pretty much said there food was ok. Our server was nice although not the fastest server. We asked for silverware because there were only 4 place settings at the table and he was nice enough to bring over some forks. After the food came I just got up and went into the servers area and grabbed knives, napkins and ketchup because I just could not wait any longer( they know they are getting their 18% tip because its already put in the check so why bother).\n",
            "For me I ordered the combo. The ribs were bad, they were basically just thrown in the oven and when done they threw on some BBQ sauce. They were not even butchered correctly. Next was the brisket, DRY DRY DRY. Then the pulled pork which was alright, the corn was ice cold, they did not even attempt to heat it up. The fries were ok and the corn bread or should I say corn muffin was ok.\n",
            "My kids and I plan on coming back to Universal next year but will stay clear of this place.\n",
            "Horrible service and the food is barely above average.  The pad woon sen barely had any noodles in it.  The waitress was useless.  We asked to split the check when we sat down but she at the end she said she could not do it.  Not coming back.\n",

            "My partner and I walked into the bar on a slow afternoon at the beginning of June.  My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap (he was looking for a summer ale).  The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, \"All the beers are listed there.  Everything is seasonal.\"  Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond.  Rude.  The bartender continued to have an \"I could care less\" cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out.\n",

            "The ambiance is lacking. There are three crystal chandeliers that look like they were left from a previous owner. The only Mexican decor was 1 sombrero on the wall.

            "Overall it is a pretty mediocre restaurant. It is nothing to write home for, though. The atmosphere is alright, but as mentioned below, they could maybe add some curtains or window tint to dim the outside sights, as there is a street light blaring into the restaurant. As well, the food is decent. Only main thing I like about this place were the drinks and people. The main reason for the 2 stars is that I have had better when it comes to small local restaurants.\n",
            "The young lady who was out server was friendly-- so this really has nothing to do with our server, but with the food. We had two apps which were Ok-- although our BBQ chicken flat bread had two pieces of chicken, and our potstickers were sort of Cajun style-- our entrees were horrible. The hubbs ordered the JD Burger which he had no serious complaints about. I had the Fridays shrimp which were not only soggy but tasted like they had been sitting. My daughters ribs-- which the server touted as fall off the bone were hard-- I am unsure how that happened but they were crispy, I could barely separate them.  We came at noon-- it was not busy I do not see how there was no attention to detail. I am extremely disappointed, and do not believe that I will be returning.\n",
            "Went to Bosphorous 2 weeks ago with my sisters for lunch. I was actually looking forward to it because it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in park avenue. As usual, we ordered humus and bread. Since we were sharing, I wanted to scoop some humus and put it in my plate. As I was doing that I noticed hair, as it was inside the humus. I immediately put my fork down and waited for a waiter. He was new so his trainer deeply scrutinized the plate in front of us, not believing. He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would she would. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I did not like the demeaning nature of this manager. I felt like he treated us like this because we were young because I am pretty sure if we were older and looked different m, he would not have all these excuses. \n",

I have also been to the Kirkman location and the Altamonte Spring one, both locations can be slammed with lunch/dinner rush, but all handled pretty well, I went to this Colonial Dr. location few times, and every time I ran into lunch/dinner rush at some weird hours: I went there for lunch at 3 pm, it was ridiculously crowded, pretty much no food left to eat. Staff were doing their best to handle the crowd, so kudos to these awesome people. I believe problem lies with the management, they need to hire more people to help out, current staff simply cannot keep up with such traffic!\n",

            "I went to Camilla's in Miami last week and we loved it. That is why we wanted to give it a try and come to Camilla's in Orlando. The menu was slightly different. My favorite things in Camilla's in Miami were the papaya, the passion fruit mousse and the variety of churrasco. On the other hand, in Orlando they did not have the papaya and neither the passion fruit mousse. The churrasco was very dry and not variety at all. They charged gratuity already in the bill (that I did not know) and I already had left tip on the table. You pay when you leave the restaurant. I was really disappointed. The Camilla's in Miami was much better!\n",
            "We come here often because it is close to home. I will just say when the food is good it is great but when it is bad it is BAD. Sometimes they cook and season the food to perfection but there has been a few times when it seemed as though we have gotten no seasoning and the chicken is burnt.\n",

They did not try to acommidate me in any way they just said our system messes up sometimes. One pizza was cold and the other one was perfect temp. The flavor was good as always but the service was horrible. AVOID THIS LOCATION!!! the asion dude that was helping me was rude and lifeless but the other guys were cool\n",

            "My first impression of this place based on Yelp reviews and just driving past it was really nice. The interior looked really cozy and comfortable. (To begin with, I am quite protective of my sister and how people talk to her. She is the sweetest girl you will ever meet, so anyone who speaks to her without an ounce of respect is on my bad side. Also, I had just received my first Oregon speeding ticket on my way here. So, I am slightly on edge already.) I walk in after my cigarette and my sister is at the counter with Rand. My first impression of Rand based on his facial expression when talking to my sister was prude and rude. When my sister finished up with him and sat down, she explained what had happened at the counter:\n",
            "\n",
            "Rand, first of all, does not seem like the friendliest of people. My sister wanted a pot of tea, and apparently they do not do that here. Okay. That is understandable. She then asked for a second cup for me with some hot water, and he paused, glances at my sister, double taps this piece of paper on the post next to the register and says \"I cannot do that. I can give you a cup, but not water.\" If he had said \"I am sorry, but we do not do that here,\" then I would have no problem. But, he did not. Next, he said that \"people have been abusing this.\" I am sorry, but abusing what, exactly? Hot water? Do you charge for hot water? Is it against policy to rebrew a tea bag instead of wasting it? What exactly are people 'abusing?' You are charging $4 for a cup of hot water with a tea bag. So do other places. With the exception of: other places do not have hosts or hostesses speaking down to anyone; it is served in a pot; are willing to give you an extra cup; and are not prude about their policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "I then go to the other gentlemen with the loose flowing hair and glasses. He is super nice. I asked for the other guy's name and he took his time to explain to me because I misheard it the first two times. Rand comes out from the back, and I ask him if he is the manager here. Verbatim, he also adds (in an extremely condescending manner) that he is \"not only the manager but the owner.\" I sit back down and take note of that, hence the first line in this review. About 30 seconds later he comes up to my table and asks \"Did you have a question?\" (Please assume that all these quotes I am referring to are spoken in a condescending manner.) I say, \"No, I just wanted your name.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Please note that I am the kindest of people until someone talks down to me or anyone I am with or know. Take a look back at my Yelp review history. I hardly write bad reviews. And I am sitting in this cafe while writing this review. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now, we can talk about why I am actually giving this place two stars (instead of one). I am not that much of a harsh reviewer if you look at my history. The reason for the two stars is because of the other gentleman with the glasses being so polite, and the tea they serve is quite good. \n",

            "I want to understand your philosophy on \"abusing a cup of hot water policy.\" I understand that you would rather I buy another cup for myself. But, It is like saying I want the espresso grounds from my espresso shot, and you refusing and charging me for it. Also, why do other tea places offer the same amount, or even less than the amount of leaves you gave for the same price? I am not from here, but Is not the Portland philosophy all about being green? Should not we reuse and recycle things that we are going to throw away? I would rather reuse the same leaves to get more out of it, as opposed to wasting leaves for just one brew.\n",
            "The food was good, especially the dumplings. We ordered appetizers and the waiter brought us a full portion, which we had to send back to the kitchen. Moreover, the service was quite pushy and not very welcoming, and the food is rather expensive.\n",
            "This was such a disappointment. After reading all the great reviews, I was determined to walk the 2 miles in hot and humid weather to eat the infamous lobster roll. The food was ok and the staff was friendly, but did a terrible job. I walked in and asked if I could sit at the bar. They said I could sit anywhere. Ten minutes later, I had to ask for a menu. I asked about the oysters and he handed me a card with their daily selection. I ordered oysters from both coasts and a lobster roll. He did not ask me if I wanted anything to drink, so I stuck with water, though I would have liked to pair a nice wine with the oysters.\n",

            "15 minutes later, the oysters came out. I had some from Maine, New York, Virginia and Washington state. I must say, Virginian oysters were the meatiest, sweetest and cleanest! I sat right in front of the bar and got to watch them shuck oysters and prep some of the dishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "45 minutes after I ordered, the host took my oyster plate and I asked to see if I still had the order for the lobster roll. It came 5 minutes later and I could not help but notice that tables that came in after me already had their entrees. It was not busy at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "The lobster roll was the perfect portion, but a little more bland than expected. The lobster was fresh and had great texture. Th fries had great flavor, but they were from the bottom of the batch, so I had a lot of little bits instead of nice long fries I saw going on other orders.\n",
            "\n",
            "The host asked if I enjoyed the lobster roll and I said it was good, just not happy with the fries and had to ask for more water. He said, \"Oh, ok\" and refilled it. My cup had been empty for over 15 minutes. No effort was made to obtain anymore feedback.\n",

But the young lady behind the counter ruined the experience for me.  It was like pulling teeth when I tried to get information on a couple of dishes.

I want them to prosper.  And maybe I will try again in the distant future.\n",

The guys behind the counter threw my sandwich together like he was on a 5 second time limit with only two customers in the entire place, why the rush? By the time they wrapped up my sandwich it was falling apart and all over the place. I rewrapped my sandwich right in front of the cashier and he did not say one word or offer any help. I was obviously annoyed when I left. I will not be back. There are too many sandwich places in Austin to deal with crap like that.\n",

The waiter *seemed* nice enough, but as soon as the dinner was done, she immediately dropped the check and considered our transaction *done.* I was not done. I waited for a good ten minutes before flagging her down and asking for dessert. Then I had to flag her down for a drink refill. I needed more napkins, but I did not want to flag her down a third time. I am a loyal Denny's customer. I order big and I tip big. It would have been so easy for her to get a big tip.

Decent menu and good beer selection make it a good choice for lunch or a weeknight dinner.  The front bar is chill with an Irish-folk band sitting around a table playing tin whistles and fiddles.  The back room has louder music.  Weekends at The Burren are packed and there are frequent lines to get in plus a cover charge.

I guess that is why as I was sitting waiting for my meal to come the waitress took back some pork chops to the kitchen... the chef just was not in a stuffing mood..  I did not bother saying anything because the waitress was to nice ...I just let it go...So would I go back, hell no..I work all day... When I go out I want comfort...

Well, 15 minutes after my order was supposed to be done I got back in line to check on my order. Come to find out my order had been done and waiting and they failed to call my name or let me know even though I had checked in when I arrived with the manager. Then after I left, we were also missing an item that I had to return to the cafe to get. The quality of the food was decent, but it was obvious the sandwiches had been done for quite a while, but overall there are a lot of kinks to work out with to-go orders.\n",

            "Meh. That says it all. I had chicken dumplings with no filling and no taste to start. Even more strange was the fact that the same dumplings came floating in my friends wonton soup. I am 100 percent positive they are just frozen product they order and charge 7 bucks for. My entree was bibimbap which actually was really good. The service was awful. She was incredibly rude. They also need to learn to time a meal. I hate being with my friends and having each dish brought out 5 minutes apart. One persons sushi came so late that we had all finished eating and were trying to flag down the waitress when the owner plopped it on the table. No explanation given for why it took so long. We then waited for about 20 minutes for anyone to come back to the table as we sat surrounded by 3 courses of dirty dishes.

I invited my family here for brunch and we were sat promptly but it did take several passings of our server before it dawned on him we did not have drink orders in, or ever water on the table.   Our server did not seen terribly concerned about this and that set the tone for the entire meal. I can take a server with no personality, so that is not a big deal-what was a big deal was the food. Everyone is egg dishes were overcooked and cold. There is nothing worse that burned eggs.  And what was not overcooked was just kind of there- with no flavor.  The potatoes, grits, biscuits, even the famed fried pickles- there was just nothing memorable about the meal. Because the server came back to check on us way after the food was dropped off, there was not much to do about the situation. For the price point, I would have expected not only better service, but food with some sort of distinction.  At least the hostess was extra friendly.\n",

So in this case, I got out my phone to show him the voucher... and it was gone. He would already redeemed it, after I placed my phone order and gave him the number. So then he basically accused me of dishonesty and stealing, because I could not show him the Groupon voucher. I did show him the redemption number and date, which was that day, since he would just redeemed it. I mean, we are talking about a 20 minute time frame here. He had my phone number... what was the problem, exactly?\n",

The evening did not start out well when the maître d' placed us in the table in the far reaches of a side room, immediately next to a private room in which a private party was being held that blared disco music. Given that the restaurant was relatively empty, it is puzzling why we would be placed in this awful table. Fortunately, the waiter noticed our discomfort after the first course of our dinner, and offered to move us into the main dining room.  There were many open tables in the main dining room and this was certainly a big improvement over where we started the evening.  But even the main dining room had its problems. We were seated at a table near the open kitchen and interestingly, an accidental one-in-an-evening crash of falling dishes smashing on the floor happened not once, not twice, but three times over the next 45 minutes.

That is pretty disappointing, even if they offer a bone-in filet as an alternative.  This alternative was satisfactory, but not really what we wanted.  When our steaks were brought out to the table for dinner, the servers had no idea who ordered which steak. And then to make matters worse, they acknowledged that they had to guess which New York strip was cooked medium and which one was cooked medium-rare. They really did not know. But since this was a family dinner, there was no problem for us to cut into each of them and make sure the right person had the right steak. The dry aged New York strip steak with an iron skillet crust was superb.  When compared side-by-side with a wet aged version, hands-down the dry aged New York strip was much better.  Better taste and better texture. The petite fillet mignon was unfortunately not cooked to order.\n",

We then decided to walk around to kill time, and when we came back, found out they had already called our name and moved on to the other customers. We told the hostess that we missed our name being called because they gave us a 30 minute wait, and she said she would move us back to the top of the list but never did. In all, we waited about 45 minutes before we all decided we had had enough. Too bad they missed our business because we were very hungry. Do not know if I will be back.\n",
            "I was surprised at the small number of non food booths. Very crowded. Some of the food looked interesting but very long lines . Especially with an entrance fee I was expecting more. Less interesting then a trip  to Granville Island .\n",
            "This place used to have great pho. Went last wed for the $6 special and place had 2 tables occupied. The pho was water down and noodles tasted like they were out of .15 ramen noodle pack. Try Tan Mi.\n",
            "Had the South End (Chicken cutlet, roasted red, lett, tomat). Chicken cutlet was cold, tasted like they were cooked from a big bag you bought at BJ's and has about a 30/70 ratio of breading to chicken. The cheese was somewhat rubbery. The sandwich was falling apart completely.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have been told their prosciutto is good so I may go back again to try that, but definitely avoiding anything with chicken cutlet in it. Only reason I landed at 2 starts was the sandwich was under $7 in the Back Bay.\n",
            "The food was good. The seating was very minimal 10 chairs max at 3 tables. The wait was pretty considerable to with small portions. Good for light to go food or a gluten free option.\n",
            "The sushi is okay and I have not been poisoned, but I only get egg or vegetarian sushi and additionally the staff are rude and honestly have no knowledge of standard sushi roll types and names.  Its cheap and in a pinch its fine, but I would never recommend it.\n",
            "This was my first and likely my last visit. I have always heard good things. The pizza was ok. I ordered pepperoni and mushroom. I never found a mushroom. My grand daughter ordered the chicken parm sub it was awful! The chicken tasted like smoke. Pizza was hot that is why it is not one star.\n",
            "Produce row used to be really, really good. They were home to the best cheesesteak in town. Now they seem to be taking more care in their ambiance and mood than to the flavor and quality of the food. The cheesesteak is now barely palatable, but, hey, the ambiance kicks ass.\n",
            "I was disappointed.  We have been going to the Bread and Ink for years.  It is changed and not for the better.  The restaurant's charming artwork is gone as well as the white tablecloths and cloth napkins.  The wait staff were inappropriately dressed...more suited for cleaning house then working in an dining establishment.  The walls and ceiling have been repainted in some odd, dark colors.\n",
            "\n",
            "The service was just OK, not great like is used to be.  Same for the food.  In years past the dinner menu was consistently very creative and the food delicious.  This used to be a classy restaurant and one of the finest in Portland.  What happened....new ownership??\n",
            "From the reviews I was honestly expecting more. I ordered two drinks and I cannot even begin to explain how watered down the margarita was!!! it was It was TERRIBLE. The guacamole tasted like it came from a package definitely was NOT fresh. Very disappointing and NOT authentic. The salsa tasted like tomato sauce no flavor what so ever. I ordered the chorizo burger. I said no tomatoes she brought it out with literally just the meat and bun. I was missing half of the condiments. They charge .75 for chips refill but do not mention when they ask you if you want more! It seemed like an okay place but needs work. Also this place definitely  is NOT family friendly as they do not have a baby changing table in the women's restroom. Our server seemed to want to talk to her friend at the bar vs take care of our table. Not worth the price. Will not be returning.\n",
            "I had been to Finz this summer with my brothers and had the most amazing salmon dish. I am talking drool worthy best-meal-I have-ever-had dish. So when it came time for my 30th birthday dinner that is obviously what I wanted. I would literally been dreaming about this salmon! If I were to base this review on that experience it would be a 5 star, hands down.\n",
            "\n",
            "The restaurant was not very busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive but things came out horribly slow. We got apps and drinks and were done with our appetizers and waited at least 10-15 more minutes before our meals came out. Slow to the point where I thought maybe our meals had been forgotten about. I ordered another drink and by the time I got it I did not want it anymore slow.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food came out and it did not look quite as I remembered. It did not taste quite as I remembered. In fact, it was pretty disappointing. \n",
            "\n",
            "Maybe it was because they had a rehearsal dinner going on, but I was not satisfied at all.  The service was slow, the food was disappointing, the overall experience just left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). It was really too bad because I had talked this place up to everyone and I left crestfallen.\n",
            "Maybe I should have been more skeptical of the 4 stars that this place had for reviews.  Perhaps we were  there on a bad day (Thursday?) but a fifty-minute wait for a barely warm crepe did NOT impress me since the cheese had congealed and was not that tasty.  The waiter had to be asked to bring more water for our meals and made no apologies for the long delay, nor did he remember the request for two more napkins and had to be asked a second time.  There were only two people working when we arrived just before noon, the cook and the waiter.  Two other people showed up not long before we left, one appeared to be an older man perhaps the owner.  We did not get a bill and did not want to wait further so I left the cash on the table and NO tip.  Very disappointed, would not go back again . . . not sure why all the favorable reviews for this place.  We had been to Crepe Susettes (sp?) on Belmont several nights before and it was somewhat better (3 stars).  All in all for my money I would go the the Original Pancake House on Barbur Blvd. and have one of its really impressive crepes, like the \"Tahitian Maiden's Dream\".  It also has superior service compared to most places, too.  Hope my yelp helps :-)\n",
            "I am really a fan of the PAD KEE MAO, so I was super excited to try their $5 PAD KEE MAO!! I went there and I am really satisfied with the test BUT the wait time was TOO LONG, I had to wait around 30 mins and I guess the average time is probably 5 mins per order! And I saw only 2people working in the cart :(\n",
            "I wish they cook faster! I would give it a try again when there is nobody in line... (T___T)\n",
            "Pretty sure everything I ate came out of a can. I almost offered them some recipes as none of things I ordered are difficult to make well....\n",
            "Meh - I feel like the belly dancing and napkin throwing is raising the bar way too much on this place.  It is a gimmick and if you remove it, I do not know that there is all that much left to talk about.  I sat outside and so I did not really get all that extra stuff - I was left to base my opinion on the food and service alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "- My party of 15 got glasses of water first.  We ordered pitchers of Sangria and got them - but never got any separate glasses for them.  So we either drank Sangria or Sangria-flavored water all night.  I asked for another glass for the water, was told \"Sure!\" and never got it.\n",

            "- I saw that the hummus was hand made - that sounded cool.  I did not realize that I had to hand make it myself.  We got several dishes of chickpeas that we crushed ourselves there at the table and the resulting hummus had no flavor.  It was like it was just chick peas - no garlic, tahini, lemon, salt etc.  just bland crushed chick peas.  \n",
            "\n",
            "- Flaming cheese tasted good but so would melted cheese I made in a frying pan at home.  Melted cheese is just a universally awesome thing, like bacon.  I feel the gimmick of lighting it up at the table is what makes people think it is better than it really is.  \n",

            "- I got the surf & turf for my main meal.  It was ok.  The lobster was tasty and cooked well.  The filet was very small and a bit fatty.  It came with bland rice and a single potato wedge, like one triangular French fry.....\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall I think this place is a lot of show and not a lot of substance.  Belly dancers and throwing napkins might make for a fun time but it does not automatically make it a good restaurant I am afraid...\n",
            "Food is generally very good.  When the owner is there the service especially from the owner is attentive.  I have frequented the tavern quite often and find the bartenders can appear cold and not really engaging,  but they are efficient enough.  \n",
            "\n",
            "This last visit I was told we could not sit outside if we were not going to order an entree.  I insisted we would order more than our share of drinks, oysters and salads but was informed that local zoning laws did not allow for seating outside of patrons who did not order an entree.  So that would mean that someone who preferred 2 dozen oysters and a salad would be breaking the law if they sat ouside.  I could have easily said we were going to order an entree as I noted most outdoor patrons seemed to have \"claimed\" but I always prefer to be up front.  No matter how I tried to explain how illogical that this appeared to be, the hostess was not listening and continually repeated the management's rules as explained to her. She kept insisting that the restaurant would be breaking \"zoning laws\" and the restaurant would suffer from seating us outdoors.   In any case we sat inside and the waitress inside was wonderful. \n",
            "\n",

            "Go here if you are starving or are going to miss a meal or two. Portions and calories out of control. I prefer quality fresh ingredients however if you want a LOT of HEAVY food this is your place! The food was definitely comfort however the menu lacks creativity I AM GOING TO. If you eat here for lunch be prepared to want a nap.\n",
            "Usually have Korean food at one of the joints in Brighton, including Super 88. But tried Apgujung for lunch today...first time even though I have lived in the neighborhood for 25 years. \n",
            "Good news:  really upscale decor, especially compared with the student dives in Brighton. I was totally surprised to see such a spacious restaurant, modern, attractive, and very nicely maintained.  And the restroom was absolutely spotless. Service was quick and responsive, and the menu was comprehensive. \n",
            "Bad news:  I had the Bibimbop for lunch. Big, nice ingredients, made the way it should be. BUT no taste!  I put in so much hot sauce, but still so bland!  Same with the side dishes... the Kim Chi had no taste. I quickly figured out that the chef had \"dumbed down\" the menu to suit the suburban Newton taste buds.  What a shame!  At least they ought to give customers the option of ordering the \"real\" spicy Korean taste. \n",
            "I am not ready to give up on this place yet. It is too nice and convenient for those of us who live in the 'burbs. Next time, I will try the Japanese menu.  Even though the staff is Korean and not Japanese, maybe they have fresh fish and can make acceptable sushi?\n",
            "My husand and I were also excited to see a sushi/Thai place so close to home. The service was alright, nice waitress but a little unattentive. We ordered spicy scallop sushi roll - the rice was warm and way too soft and mushy.  The flavor was lacking as well. We ordered beef panang - the panang had an excellent rich flavor which would be worth going back for. The beef however tasted extremely budget. It had a \"Walmart beef\" flavor, was chewy, and the after taste was gamey. I ate the vegetables only.  The Thai iced tea was just OK. The size was fantastic and we were excited when we first saw it, but then when we tasted it, it was very watered down or weak tasting. This all being said, the whole experience was a little disappointing. They are new and I am sure the menu and food will evolve with some honest feedback. I wish them luck!\n",
            "coffee is good. ambience is good (except for the smell of sour milk). service sucks. the owner is rude and seems mildly paranoid (of what, I am not sure). if not for the poor service I would frequent this place more often. hopefully it will undergo new ownership soon and become the charming neighborhood cafe it deserves to be.\n",
            "Pepperoni used to be fantastic.  According to employee it was changed 2 weeks ago to be more \"cheesy\" and now only has a tiny amount of pepperoni - instead of wide thick slices they have very thin small slices.  It is no longer any good in my opinion.  They lost a 20 yr customer.\n",
            "Needs vast improvement. The menu is beautiful and the food is good... salty and not appropriately priced, but good. Service left much to be desired. The poor bartender was tending bar and waiting tables. Has great promise but needs better management.\n",
            "We had high hopes for this Ramen place, but sadly it was disappointing. \n",
            "We came on a Saturday for lunch. The food took too long to arrive and my \"garlic\" ramen had absolutely no flavor. The noodles were thick and were too crammed into the broth. The pork belly was ice cold. The tacoyaki was pretty good, but our pig ear appetizer again was very bland. \n",
            "If you want good ramen, go to Daruma.\n",
            "I am sorry to say that this restaurant was a big disappointment.  I was expecting interesting and fresh interpretation of Asian food.  Instead it was overpriced, small portioned and nothing special whatsoever.  The waiter was overly enthusiastic about everything, but ultimately unhelpful (\"awesome\" was his response to all questions).  We had carrots, beef chow fun, scallops, egg rolls.  Nothing was great or even good.  I would have preferred classic Chinese food over this.\n",
            "I have walked past this place for nearly a year and decided to give it a try for lunch today. It always looks empty and today was no exception. I get in barely get greeted and see 3 people standing behind the counter doing absolutely nothing. I looked at the menu. Ordered the mexicali breakfast burrito and the lady tells me that they do not do burritos after 10am yet it is only 10:30 at the time of my order. I say ok and she says \"we have bagel sandwiches still\". Keep in mind I have braces and she can clearly see this. So I ended up ording the roma wrap. It was basic like something I could make better at home and it costed $11 bucks with a water. Ridiculous. \n",

            "Two stars for the music they have playing that is it and the art they have on the walls. Pass on this place. They seriously are in need of help learning how to run a business. If I were to guess it seems to me that they are owned by someone who does not have any passion or need to run the business but instead just opened the place because they had extra money laying around and wanted to say, \"Hey I once owned this cafe blah blah blah\".\n",

I have eaten at Costello's about 10-12 times and every time I regret it. The only decent thing on the menu is the chicken fingers, and let us just be honest, they probably come frozen from a bag. The nachos are TERRIBLE, the pizza is bland and so on. \n",

            "Tonight i was in the mood for something good, so i finally stopped into this spot after driving past it numerous times. I ordered an arepa, not sure what they were but i love good food and was open to something new. First, the counter girl was not that friendly, considering they have many arepas to choose from and they are not in English, so i had some questions. Okay, second, the one i did order sounded delish but was so bland i stood in my fridge searching for something to dump on it and flavor it up a little bit. I also got sweet plantains that were anything but sweet. As i write this review, my stomach still feels like it is processing this food nine hours later and my tastebuds are still craving for something delicious. Lastly, the sandwich and plantains were very pricey, i really should have went next door to trackside where the food IS good.\n",
            "Went for the first time.  Way too expensive for the portions.  Got the Lobster roll, good lobster meat on a 4\" hotdog bun.  Wife got a shrimp roll and it was served with the tails still on the  shrimp!  Overall, was worth a try but will not make a return trip.\n",

It was not too bad, during that time we were looking through the menu so when we got sat down we would know what to order. By the way, if you have time, take a look at the menu... Becuase it is HUGE! There is so much on the menu it is a bit overwhelming. But the good thing about this place, if you are vegetarian, you have a ton of options! WHICH IS GREAT! My friend also happened to be vegetarian, so she had a bunch of options to choose from. We picked out what we wanted and we were ready. So our buzzer rang and we got sat down. We saw people with a ​really long plastic bottle of beer like the ones you see while you are on spring break. Gnarly dude. \n",

She asked us what we wanted to drink, we said water and that we wanted to go ahead and order. She said she will be back with our waters and will take our order. She disappeared and we were literally waiting 5 mins. 5 mins may see short but it is not when you are coming back with waters. Then she takes our order. The food takes forever to bring us our food. She did not come back to refill our waters. We had to ask other waiters to give us condiments and extra plates. She never comes to check on us. Then she finally comes when we are done with our food. We asked for our checks. Yet again we are waiting about 10 minutes for her to bring us our checks. She never came, so we ended up going up front and then she finally gave us our checks.  \n",

Then my friend ordered a vegetarian chicken bowl and I ordered the entree chicken salad which was pretty good. The only sad thing was there was no chicken to be found... Sad day. There is also the small and large portion. I ordered the small and it was plenty! The price of the food was ok for what you get. \n",

I wanted the angry chicken wings but they did not have them available. The food was bland, greasy, small portions. The butter chicken has a few pieces of chicken in a greasy saucy. The lamb curry also bland and greasy. The veggies were soggy and indistinguishable.  They did not give me a heat option either. Dissapointing.\n",

Not sure, but it took almost 10 minutes to get our order.\n",

            "I really want to like this place, but I had to stretch to give it two stars. How can it take 1 hour from ordering to being served? The restaurant was only 10% full at 6PM on a Sunday. One hour sitting with bread and water? When the food arrived, the chicken parmigiana was pre-formed, as though it had been frozen, not made to order. It was dry as sawdust. The pasta side was as though from a box, with a skimpy amount of what tasted like Ragu jarred sauce.  The pappardelle pasta dish was better.  This is my third visit in five years.  Each time I think it has to be better, but it is not.  Too bad because the atmosphere is great, but some dishes are great others are terrible.\n",

The food quality was passable by bar standards. I ordered a meatball sub with fries. The sub was pretty good, though I could have gotten the same thing at Subway for less money. The bar does have a pretty good beer list. The bartender was not familiar with the mixed drinks my friends requested, but they were able to find the drink recipes.\n",

No one who has ever been to the Costa Brava would put bland, sweet sauce on fried potatoes and call them \"patatas bravas.\" And the tortilla was cold, rubbery, and bland too.

We decide to inform the server that the chicken did not taste fresh, she states \"Well, it is the chicken that we have been serving all day and it is the same chicken in your coconut soup.\"  By the way, the chicken in the coconut soup tasted old as well.\n",
            "Instead of just taking it back, the sever got a bit of an attitude with us.  My understanding of customer service is that when a patron tells you something is not right with your food you apologize, take the food back and offer another solution.... none of which she did.  The server was more concerned about how much we were going to have to pay for the replacement food than the fact that chicken literally tasted rotten.\n",

About 450 for six with only 4 consuming any liquor. My plate had under cooked prawns and scallops that were barely warm, over cooked salmon and two pieces of a mass produced frozen portion controlled stuffed prawn. The butter sauce for the lobster was foul. It came cold on a candle warmer and left a feeling on the inside of the mouth like lard. Clarified butter was requested and was brought to the table as though it was a major request. It was not any warmer, barely liquid. I knew better than to go there after several other subpar experiences but I had friends from Calgary who had requested seafood. Next time it is McDonalds for filet o fish.\n",

This is not just a little bit of bean seepage. This is a total lack of caring about my food and whether or not I can eat it. I would also understand if this only happened once or twice - maybe it was an accident, but he was in a rush and it was easier just to give me a messy taco instead of take the time to make a new one, but this happens every single time. \n",

The combo comes with miso soup and a drink. The miso soup was standard, slightly more salty but these things vary day to day and I would rather have more salt than less.  The sushi arrived with 6 pieces of each roll on both sides of plate with an adequate amount of ginger and a not nearly enough amount of wasabi in the center.  The wasabi was decent.  I have had better, but I have had worse.  Of course I know it is not real wasabi blah blah blah.    The rolls were loose, contained more avocado than fish, and none were spicy.  At all.  They must have forgotten that part.  The tuna (usually red) and the salmon (usually orange) looked so much alike that even the waitress asked if I needed help telling them apart.   Service was friendly enough.  The dining room is clean and the music was some weird circus tunes. Nonetheless, I was pretty disappointed today. I should have gone to the HEB and bought their sushi to go.  You get fatter, more flavorful rolls for half the price.  Yeah, I said it.  I eat HEB sushi rolls.\n",
            "Food is ok. Service is not so good lately.  This place use to be really good. I think they have gotten too busy and do not have the staff to keep up with the crowds. Food is often cold and plan to wait a long time.  It is faster for us to drive all the way to Saint Cloud and eat at Koffee Kup than to wait here. Hard to write such a review as the owners are great.  However they also need to care more about the quality of their service.\n",

Prices went up, portions went down, and the decor ( including the sign outside) became .....ugly and cheap in my opinion. Another thing, minor and stupid, but it bothered me.....the pasta bowls are are tacky with pictures of macaroni on them! I do not know what is going on to my favorite restaurant ...they need an image consultant big time. Food is still great, but Porcini's is not our first choice anymore.\n",

Let me preface this review with the fact that the game was at 2:00 in the afternoon and the restaurant was empty. We walked in and we were greeted with a snub \"Sit in the bar, over there.\" As we sat down in the area the waitress pointed to, she came over to take our order but first pointed out that \"For your information, this is not the bar. Next time you ask to sit in the bar it is over there\" as she proceeds to wave her finger pointing to the correct bar seating. I could go on about how rude this girl was, but I will just end this with a whoppin two stars.\n",

Took even longer for the recook and we got a sorry excuse for an apology from the manager who did not offer to comp or discount our meal for waiting inconveniently and the fact their kitchen staff does not wear hair nets. Disgusting.\n",

However I have a real problem with any restaurants that try and throw out authentic names (for instance Italian with this place) for their menu items, and not use authentic ingredients. We ordered the \"Gruppo\" pizza and were very disappointed with the quality of the toppings on the pie. The crust was was decent. I will give them that. Had a very nice texture. But do not call little dried up balls of meat with no flavor \"Italian sausage\". The \"Canadian bacon\" was cut into little triangles that you could get on any pizza from Dominos or Pizza Hut. And the pepperoni may have come from a local Safeway. Needless to say, we did not get what we expected. And the decor was a little much with all the cycling jerseys hanging everywhere. The search for good AUTHENTIC ingredients continues.\n",

It was fine but not remarkable.  Again though, the service here Just sucks. I mean they have the worst unapologetic attitude and we wait forever. Forever to get the waitress to take our order, forever to get our coffee, forever to get our food....And they have an attitude that is just awful about it.

Forget that breakfast is usually the easiest meal to custom make- that often they take 2 minutes to cook eggs and make it to order.  Forget the fact that my friend was a vegetarian. They will not make any substitutions.  When my friend begged them to leave the bacon off at they would not. When she asked for tomatoes instead, they said she could order them on the side for 3.95.  3.95??? And that is what she did and they literally gave her a saucer with tomatoes.  \n",

I mean it was unusual - I have never been to a restaurant that refused to make any substitutions for breakfast  and her attitude towards my friend was almost as bad as, \"well, you should not be a vegetarian.\" Despite my food being good, I have not gone back and I am not sure i will. Lots of good breakfast in Atlanta- no one should feel like a criminal for not eating meat.\n",
            "We have tried this twice since its recent opening.  The first time we had several different sandwiches, soups and pastries to take home.  Everything tasted fresh and pretty much like Panera is supposed to taste. However the second time we went, we were in the line next to the pastry/bread case.  Inside the case we observed at least ten flies under the glass feasting on the goodies.  Every time an employee grabbed a Danish or scone, we cringed knowing that some unsuspecting customer was about to eat something that had most likely been sampled by a fly or two.  We mentioned to the girl about the flies, but she pretended not to hear us.  Our order consisted of one sandwich to go and we have not been back.  If they can figure out how to keep the flies off the food, we will go back.\n",
            "Wife and I with our 2 year old boy decided to try this place out due to some of the good reviews here. The Food was alright, taste something closer to Home Made compare to other Thai restaurants out there. We had the pad Thai and Thai style fried rice (with the philosophy if a place got the basic right, the other dishes would be good as well). Portion per dish was large, enough for 2 people. \n",
            "But the SERVICE was somewhat unpleasant, the lady with short hair who served us was RUDE!! We got a glass that was dirty with thick detergent residue and floating white things in it. When we requested a new clean glass of water, she gave us an attitude and insist that the glass was clean. I took a napkin and wipe some of the obvious part, surely enough it came off and formed tiny bubbles. \n",
            "At this point she still insist that all the glass were the same and stormed off with the glass and brought us another set of similar dirty glass, filled it with water and serve it back to us. \"See all the same!\" Needless to say we did not drink it and chose not to pick a fight with this person. \n",

We have had Aj's before, and it was just ok...I have had their pizza, which was not the best, and spaghetti with meatballs which was again, just ok.  My Boss comes in to me today,  with a list of items to order from Ugh, AJ's, and I was to order what ever I wanted.  I know not to get pizza or Spaghetti and meatballs, so I go online for a menu....site is down..  I called AJ's and asked for a menu to be faxed......fax is broken.  I will pass on food from AJ's.\n",

            "When you read a critical review among a sea of positive reviews, your first impression is the reviewer in question is nitpicking or simply crazy. I can assure you that I am neither. Rather I am surprised this hotel has received such strong praise. Overa6ll, I would not recommend this hotel. This does not resemble the service and quality of rooms found in the New York Waldorf among others. As one reviewer said: \"It is a Waldorf in name only\" and I agree with this. \n",
            "\n",
            "First, our room was hot. And not just the room, the entire hallway outside was warm as if you were standing outside. Our thermostat was deliberately set so that you could not lower it below 68 degrees. And even at 68 degrees, it felt more like it was 75 degrees. When we complained to the front desk, the technician arrived and removed this restriction so that you could set it to 62 degrees. We set the unit at 62 degrees and the unit could not go below 67 which felt like 74-75. It was clear from our standpoint, that the thermostat was clearly off and the A/C unit was not efficient. This is what I would expect from a motel and not a supposed 5 star hotel. \n",

            "Another reviewer cited the questionable size of their King bed claiming it was a Queen size bed. This was our experience as well. The bed was small and it clearly was not a King size bed in our opinion. \n",

            "Many reviewers cited the pool as being a plus. I find that hard to believe. The pools were standard square pools that can be found in any 2 or 3 star hotel. Actually, the pool at the conjoined Hilton had a much nicer pool. The Hilton pool had a lazy river with a nice long snake like shape with a beautiful layout. \n",
            "\n",
            "This leads me to my second point. The Hilton Bonnet Creek Resort is attached to the Waldorf Astoria (in case you were not aware of this).  The Bonnet Creek was a much nicer hotel in our opinion. It is lobby was larger and more gallant. It had a much more festive Christmas decoration and a livelier ambience. We originally booked with the Bonnet Creek, but they oversold their rooms so they moved us to the Waldorf as an \"courtesy upgrade\" We read between the lines and insisted we would prefer to stay at the Bonnet Creek but no such luck, they had no rooms left.  It was fairly obvious that most people preferred to stay at the Hilton than the Waldorf and you can understand why.  \n",
            "\n",
            "So what was good about the hotel? The service was fantastic. Everyone was polite and friendly. The hotel is new so it is very contemporary. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. The shower amenities were Salvatore Fergamo. A blue ray player was included in the room. The sheets smelled clean and the bed was well made.  The floors were quiet as well. The guests seem to be fairly classy and there were no loud and obnoxious people which can make a stay less enjoyable. \n",

The food also took a long time to come out (about 15 minutes), which was surprising given we only ordered two veggie egg sandwiches. Once the food finally came out we asked for the check with it to make a quick getaway. Fortunately I noticed when we walked in you had to pay by the front door and not wait for the waiter-i have read some people just wait for 10-15 minutes not knowing this. The food was alright. Certainly not subpar, just standard. I was just happy that it came out hot. It was pretty greasy, but so is everything there ;) \n",

The portion was less than generous,  and the fries were stubby and soggy. I thought we got the end of the bag,  but I looked around and at least one other table also got shafted with the fries. Bottom line,  if I pay for fries,  it better be good. Do not serve subpar fries and make customer pay for it.\n",

To top it off, the staff turned the music off 45 min before the place closed and started eating at the table next to ours. Turned out to be a really awkward experience so we quickly finished our food and left......with 90 less bucks. Oh and for those of you who like low lighting, this place was pretty bright so do not go here for a romantic date.\n",

Now the noodles and peanut and egg were yummy after there was no more meat but I did not pay $3 more for a vegetarian meal. I ended up cooking some Purdue chicken strips slicing them and adding them to the 70% of noodles that remained! Perhaps try a cheaper meat to see what they do not skimp on.\n",

My main complaint is about the dirty water they served us. Myself and 3 other friends did not notice the little black and white specks at the bottom of our glasses until we were almost done drinking it. We complained and our server did apologize.\n",

            "I really wanted to like this place better, so I have given it a bunch of tries, but there are just so many things that are disappointing (particularly with so many choices of locally owned coffee shops).  The coffee is meh, the food portions are really, really small (I always leave hungry), and pretty expensive.  You have to pay for WiFi, and though a lot of the staff is friendly, there is one guy there that is really rude and arrogant.  You have a lot of choices, so I would want to see them try a lot harder for me to recommend True Grounds\n",

On a Sunday morning of a holiday weekend, they only had 1 register open. The lines were just ridiculous with no clear direction of what was happening. Anyway, we ordered our box of donuts and just decided to try 4- Old Fashioned Buttermilk, Basil Bourbon Blueberry, Maple Bacon, and Apple Fritter. To be fair, I did not try them right away as we had just eaten a huge breakfast but instead had them the next morning. I was sooo disappointed. :( I could not even eat the Maple Bacon...it had a really weird flavor to it. I think it would have been better if the bacon were cooked prior to being put on the donut. My favorite was the old fashioned....though the icing was extremely sweet. The consistency of the donuts were really dense and I felt like they used too much lemon zest in their glaze. Inside the store, you are able to watch the employees package up the donuts for you. There was no sense of urgency to their motions even though the line was out the door. I almost wanted to go help the lady individually wrap each donut in paper before putting them into the box. It was just a really strange experience that did not make a lot of sense from an operation standpoint.\n",

Ordered the huevos rancheros: two eggs with average salsa, a small portion of black beans that looked and tasted like they were out of a can, some potatoes and two store-bought tortillas for $9. Underwhelmed and disappointed in light of all the gushing about this place. This place does have a cool vibe, but it is betrayed by the food.\n",

The rice was a little too dry, and the pork chop was not flavorful. Taiwanese pork noodle soup was OK but not special, and it took so long (extra 15-20 minutes after the rice got served) that my husband almost finished his rice.. Tofu with syrup was the best among the three dishes, very authentic yet still did not stand out. Maybe we just did not get the right food to eat?\n",

My coworkers seemed satisfied with their orders except for the one who got the salad.  The salad did not look appetizing, resembling a prepackaged or bagged salad in a bowl, and most of it was left untouched/uneaten on the table.

However, tonight I got a pizza and stix, and was very disappointed.  The stix were made of some \"version\" of cheese, but it was the consistency of warm Brie - disgusting!  And then I realized there was a similar consistency to the cheese on the pizza.  All smooth and creamy.  I do not know what the heck they were using today, or if they plan on continuing to use this  nasty material.  I will need to find out before I ever order anything with cheese from them again!!\n",
            "Used to dine there regularly with the wifey, but we were forced to find another place. My wife drinks decaf coffee and Camino Real's is made from a packet - absolutely awful, so my wife began bringing in her own decaf coffee from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf up the street. After doing this twice, the third time we noticed a handwritten sign taped to the front door forbidding any outside food or drink. We poured her coffee into an unmarked styrofoam cup and went inside, only to be told not once, but three times that we could not bring in outside food or drinks. We explained that their decaf coffee was unacceptable and even offered to pay for a cup of their coffee, but they did not care. They would rather lose two long-time customers (I had been eating there weekly for over 15 years) over this. Guess that is their prerogative, but this forced us to find another weekend breakfast place. Fortunately we found an even better place for Mexican breakfast - Juarez Mexican Bakery in Round Rock. Their decaf coffee is brewed fresh and their breakfast tacos and miga plates are even better than Camino Real.\n",

Also this is the first time offering any sort of compensation in over a year of going there and many many mess ups.

Once we were ready for dessert, the other non-birthday girl went to confirm the order.  She had a very confusing conversation with the maitre-d, and then he came to the table and proceeded to have a loud whispered conversation with her, completely ruining the surprise and creating an awkward moment or two.

The food was decent, but the service was awful. Understandably the service for a buffet lunch does not need to be over the top, but we were not even offered drink menus (at all). When I asked for a menu, the waitress just asked me what I wanted and tried to improvise it seems. I ordered a glass of Prosecco while my mother ordered a Bellini. When she brought the drinks, my Prosecco was pink (appeared to be a rose Prosecco, which is new to me) and my mother's Bellini looked like a Mimosa (with an orange in it). She did not provide much explanation as to why my Prosecco was pink (fine) but then she proceeded to take it away from me before I was finished - my ultimate pet peeve.

The third time I went there was today with my kids, The wait was not bad, the staff is super friendly, BUT, they brought the fries out very early and they were luke warm to cold. Then they brought us our Milk Shakes which were great, and then about 5-10 minutes later they finally brought us our Burgers. Here is where I have a problem, I like a medium burger but that is when you have a bit of a chair or grill on the outside, the burger seemed as if it was just flat out under cooked (mushy). The bun was soggy from the grease and the lettuce was warm and limp. I spent $50 for me and my two girls, I would not recommend this place. I can get a much better burger for less at Boardwalk Burgers on Lamar next to the broken spoke for about $28, I know this because we eat there on a reg basis. They also serve nice hot fries with the burger at the same time. This place is not as good as it used to be.

My friend got the Hamachi & said the rice was clumped and dry, and did not taste the jalapeno at all.  Best thing was the Loup Crudo - this is the kind of food I was expecting, but we had to eat it fast because the bus boy tried to take our plate twice with food remaining!  This is a tiny $16 plate.

When I called at 5:30, yesterday, when they open, the lady on the other end told me that they had no records indicating that I had ever called. To add insult to injury, she was very rude as she explained that they had JUST filled their final spot and that there was nothing they could do for me, aside from possibly giving me an 8:30 slot....I do not know about you, but I am not interested in sleeping all night with beef tartare in my belly!\n",

We were very pleased that we had our own private room for dining, however we all had several complaints. First off, the menu is limited. There really are no lighter menu options. The salads are way over priced and not an option as a meal (unless you fill up on bread first). Lastly, our service was just okay. Slow to the start and lacking personality. Pretty sure we will not be back.\n",

I do not know of any other coffee shop that does not give at least 1 refill on drip coffee. Seriously? $2+ for a single mug of coffee, $ 5+ for a piece of ciabatta and an egg? We just felt like the value for what we had was just not there. The lady behind the counter was nice enough, but for the prices, we  do not want a pick up your food at the counter and bus your own table kind of atmosphere. It almost felt like there was an underlying contempt for the customer. The place was cramped and we could not even walk in through the front door without having to turn sideways and weave through the cluster of chairs, tables and people. I do not think I will ever spend my dollars here again.\n",

It was better than pizza...\n",

I had pork sliders...dry, flavorless pork, nothing special coleslaw on extremely soggy basic white buns. My husband had the street tacos...same dry flavorless pork and soggy tortillas..no zip at all. Both came with chips, which normally neither of us really eat..we ate all because they were the best part of the meal. Unfortunately I do not think they can even take credit for them. I am sure they were Cascade brand. \n",

I say hello how are you? She says do i know you? I said that I have been in a few times and we usually sit in a booth. She says i do not know you I would remember. So I order a special and explain to her that the last two times my girlfriend and i were in, we ended up leaving because we could not get any service after sitting for 20 minutes or so. I remember this woman because the last time we did actually get service she was rude as hell! So that comment completely enrages the woman. All i was doing was trying to share with her our last couple experiences. She proceeds to scream at me and tells do not come back our I will call the cops! Really? For what being honest? I Am humiliated and embarrassed! I go p pay my tab and give her a tip. She throws the tip money on the floor! The lady has no buisness being in customer service! And Ill damned if I will spend another dollar in that restaurant, nor will i be recommending it anymore!! The management should be appalled at the way this woman carries her self and represents the establishment! Shame on you.\n",

The lunch-time cashier was extremely off-putting from the time I walked up to the counter. When she called my order for pick up, she 1.) Never looked up from her cell phone, 2.) Did not respond at all when I said thank you. I thought maybe she did not hear me so I said thank you again but not once did she reply nor look up from her phone.  If an establishment does not want customers on the phone while giving their order they definitely should not tolerate their front line employees on the phone while in front of customers either.  A simple smile, welcome, thank you and have a nice day  goes a long way to maintain returning patrons.\n",

            "The place looks very beautiful and had outdoor seating. The setting nice. However the music did not go with the feel of the place and the speaker placement made it very difficult for our waitress to hear. The waitress seemed like she was having a bad day so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But then she seemed to be nicer and more attentive to other guest than to our table. She also made excuses for herself. The Ceviche and Oysters were good but the crab cocktail was quite salty not inedible but still not the best. I ordered the clam chowder and halibut tartare. The clam chowder was salty and bitter! It had more bacon than clams in it. It was a very runny and watery consistency. I could not even handle the bitterness so I only ate a few bites. The halibut tartare was like eating salt. Way too salty and too much bacon. I expected more because it was a 4 stars and three dollar signs! I payed  $40 to eat salt. 2 star rating from me I liked the setting and the raw bar was pleasing to me. I also tried my friends blue cod and enjoyed it. However the other dishes were just awful and I walked out still hungry and upset. I did not enjoy my experience but some of my friends enjoyed it. But I will not be coming back\n",

Last night we ordered take out, our usual three entrees. Each dish was surprisingly different and not in a good way. What we have always liked about this place is the flavor of each dish was bold yet refined. A delightful blending of complex aromas and flavors. Last night's trio was bland and flat.

It turned really bad when I decided to have a corporate happy hour with my co workers which included the higher ups.  BIG mistake.  They did advise that they do not do separate checks.  What they failed to advise was that you have to tally up what you owe on your own.  Not only that, our waitress was a B-I-T-C-H.  You may have to repeat that to each person that has to leave because they did not know that but you do not have to take that tone with them.  These are people that make 6 figures and do not really care what they have to pay.  I was so embarrassed.  Needless to say, when I heard that another group from Sandy Springs government was going to have happy hour there and I was invited, I warned them and they opted not to go.  So be warned.\n",

When the dinner bill arrived the waiter added the paid for drink on the tab, when it was pointed it out to him, he argued and said we were wrong. It took three times for him to agree and remove the charge. Fish was \"OK\" and for the prices should be better and the service also better and not so arrogant. Very disappointed. Atmosphere is nice but Austin has a lot of nice atmospheres.\n",

When she repeated our order (after I asked her to) two of our five items were wrong and one was not even there. So we repeated our order. We ordered a bagel with ham, cheese and egg and another with cream cheese and egg. We never got our brownie (because even though we repeated it three times she did not ring it up) and so we had to ask for it in the front of a line of disgruntled people who would been waiting for awhile.

The sushi is poorly rolled, standards at this restaurant has dropped. For long time customers like me, we taste the difference.  They think that getting some asian guys to wrap rice in seaweed is sushi. Some traditional japanese dishes are taken off the menu. It is going down the same way as Ginza.

I cannot speak for the quality of the food or service in the dining room, but based on the bar experience, overrated!\n",

The potatoes were half good, half burnt.  The bacon on my sandwich suffered from either freezer burn or was left over from yesterday--dry and brittle and tasteless.

This order was a pick up and the person on the phone was very short and rude, as was the person at checkout when my husband picked up our order.

There were only three cooks (that looked miserable).  The waitstaff spent more than a few minutes glaring into the kitchen, waiting for their tables' food.  Perhaps their time would have been better spent attending to their customers, as I saw one patron actually walk into the kitchen with his bill and credit card since no one was coming to him.  Other times I saw the waiters boss around the servers, ordering them to fill waters, bring out bread, wrap up leftovers, and even smile (30 pieces of flare, anyone?).\n",

            "I am a huge fan of this bar in Boston. I come here a lot and I always recommend that my friends stop by here and enjoy their weekends. But this time when I went I was very unsatisfied to the point where I could not enjoy my night there 100% due to the employees. First the security kept harassing my friends and I about our wardrobe all throughout the night. I do not understand why especially because they check out for that at the front door with security. And then the worst part about the night was the rude service I got from one bartender in particular. The first bartender I went to was very friendly and even though I could tell she was a little frustrated with the crowd she had a great attitude about it. But the next bartender that serviced me was VERY VERY VERY RUDE. After I ordered my food she gave me and attitude, slapped the bar and screamed \"PAY NOW\". Then when I gave her the money, she threw the money on the bar and walked away to the next person. She did not put my order in until after she serviced 3 or 4 more people. And when I asked her she never answered and gave me the \"hold on finger\" with an attitude. I eventually had to ask the nicer bartender about my order. Not only was my bar experience HORRIFIC and uncomfortable (because she seemed a bit racist as well) but when I went to report the incident to management he made every excuse for her horrible customer service. As far as I am concerned as a bartender you know exactly what your job entitles you to handle. You know it is going to be crowded and crazy but that does not mean you are supposed to be rude about it. Suck it up and do your job with grace.  I love Hong Kong but unfortunately they will never receive my money again. Or any of my friends and family who are equally dissatisfied. Hopefully they will be under new management with respectful bartenders one day so I can enjoy them again. Until then this bar is a complete no go.\n",

The service is slow, and incapable of simple things, like giving us plates, silver wear, napkins, and water. Why ask for how we liked out burgers cooked if all of them in the party come out well done and cold to touch. We waited over an hour for food on a weekday night. The only reason I give this place a two star review is the manager on duty that evening admitted to their shortcomings, apologized and gave us a significant discount. We expressed our concerns and we stated that they seemed very understaffed. Stick the the locations south of the Columbia river.\n",
            "Went on a quiet Sunday evening. Upon entering, did not see anyone and no one welcomed us. Finally someone came and asked how many in our party. We were seated in a side room and forgotten. I had to walk to the bartender to ask about someone to take out order. Things were dropped off and the waiter disappeared again. I tried to go back up to the bar to request ranch and later extra sauce. Employees walked past to & from an office by the kitchen without anyone asking if I needed something. There is a bad vibe here that they really do not care if you are here, and get around to waiting on you when they feel like it. The food was wonderful!!!  But - even with great food, it is not a good feeling to feel invisible or uncared about when you take the time to choose a restaurant to eat at. Extremely disappointing. They need a new focus on customer service, and making people feel welcome. Did not used to be like this.\n",

When I asked her about the Ribeye Steak Frites dinner she was not cruel enough to recommend it.  The food here is below average.  It may have been operator error as I ordered Calamari as an appetizer.  It seemed to be previously frozen or overcooked.  It was very rubbery and did not have much taste.  My wife and I both ordered different burgers.  Although the meat for the burger seemed to be good quality the burgers themselves were not anything great.  They were undersized as compared to the buns and just were not great for the money.  Beers were good and cold.  And there was a good beer selection.  Maybe if I had stayed with wings or nachos I would have been happier with the night.  But based on this experience, I will not be giving it another try.

From all the positive reviews about the duck noodle soup I really expected a great meal.  The soup was only OK for me.  The broth was a bit more on the salty side for my taste and the dish was mostly noodles with only a few thinly sliced pieces of duck.  Hubby's fried rice was decent.  The counter service was OK.  They muttered something I did not understand so I just paid for my food and left.  My understanding of Asian accented English must be getting worse than I thought.

Big chunks of undercooked  cold potato and tough meat with a helping of watery sour beets stuck on top as though each ingredient had been shoveled out of a separate tupperware container. Noticed a few patrons looking at it equally skeptically. The dad had one of the eggs benedict concoctions and the poached eggs were hard. Only daughter who had the burger was happy, but at $35 one might hope so. The fruit tart was nice but not special, the chocolate tart a big hunk-a-dry chocolate on a pastry base.

I thought the price was a little steep at this quality. The chips were cut thick and good (I have not had a fry I did not like) but the coleslaw came from a bag in the fridge. The pieces of fish were substantial but it was pretty flavorless and I wondered if they came from a bag in the freezer... the tarter sauce was supposedly homemade and good but you only get a little bit in a teeny plastic cup. You can get a pint of beer brewed right on Granville Island for $5 which was nice but I recommend seeking out another place for decent fish and chips.\n",

Yet the folks at this pub cater to a clientele who does not even know who Joyce is. The ceilings are way too high to feel anything like an Irish pub, and their logo is a ridiculous penciled caricature of the serious, thoughtful writer wearing what appears to be a cowboy hat. Not only this, but the night I went, there was some sort of pirate convention that was allowed to take over the entire bar/patio/restaurant area. Some pirate man came up and plopped a half-eaten piece of cake on our table, offering it to us and claiming that there were no germs on it.

Restaurants that partake are to offer a fixed price menu of either $18, $28 or $38 for a three course meal.  It is a wonderful chance to try a bit of what every restaurant has to offer.  Edible Canada's menu was $28 for a three-course dinner.  Appetizer, entree and dessert.  HOWEVER!  In each course there would be at least one item that would have an additional charge.  These charges ranged from $2-$20.  This completely defeats the purpose of Dine Out!  It is up to the restaurant to be creative and work within the parameters of their budget,  Otherwise guests may as well be ordering off their regular menu.  They are the only restaurant I have come across so far that has done this and it rubbed me the wrong way.  It came off as nickel-and-dime-ish and it did not impress me that the chef or owners were not creative enough to come up with selections that could adhere to the premise of the festival.

My wife ordered brussel sprouts and she literally could not eat them...and she loves Brussel Sprouts.... six bucks for inedible brussel sprouts.  Our fries were cold, too.   Ugh.   For appetizers we tried the scallops and box of onions.  The box of onions were good and I would order them again.  The scallops were not my thing as they had a very strong flavored melted cheese on them that overwhelmed those beautiful scallops.

It came to me still mooing. I have never been served a steak so raw. When I asked her if she could put it back on the grill a little longer, it came back dry and tough as leather. I have had their omelets before and they are pretty decent, but I do not think I will come back.

We had trouble selecting plates because neither of us found the offerings particularly appealing.  I am a vegetarian and he is not.  We settled on the Sunchoke plate and the Shiitake Pasta plate to start.  Delivered first was the Sunchoke dish.  I needed to sit up in my chair and peer down into the bowl to see the food.  We then started laughing. Hysterically.  The portion was so tiny.  While we have lots of experience with small plates around Austin, this was the final straw. I cannot recall cost of this dish, but it appeared to contain a few pennies worth of food; there was enough for one bite each.  Neither of us cared for it unfortunately.  Next up was the Shiitake pasta, again just enough for a bite or so each.  I did not like this dish at all.  My husband said that he felt badly for the waitress and decided to eat it and tell her that it was good.  We then asked for our check and left to get dinner elsewhere. We were starving.

However, I tried the smothered porkchop and it had more bones than meat.The lighting was bad, there was only one person serving the buffet at the time I went thru.  The buffet table did not appear to be on to keep the food warm so my food ranged from warm to luke warm. They kept running out of food and there was a wait for things like fried chicken and cornbread so I never got to try those. Thought dessert came with the buffet  but could not tell if there was any on the line. Lastly, i saw one of the ladies wash tongs in a hand wash sink near the buffet that already had a plate in it.

Granted, he was the only server at the time, I think. I got the chicken tenders with mac n cheese and the duck fat fries and my husband got the 1/4 chicken w/ sautéed spinach and sweet potato fries. The mac n cheese was ok. The tenders were ok too but the sauce that it came with was awful. The fries were the best part. I guess it is kind of hard to mess them up though.

It was a little tight as far as seating went but we were a large group, so I get it. However, my biggest gripe came at the end of the meal. As we were waiting for the bill 2 people who were waiting to be seated came up to our table and very rudely asked if we were done eating. They stated that they were from out of town (it is Austin, everyone is from out of town) and they had been waiting to be seated for 2 hours (they decided to show up in the afternoon, on a Saturday, at a trendy restaurant). There were plenty of other people waiting outside and none of them were complaining. As this was happening none of the staff bothered to intervene. That was where the visit went south for me. There should have been someone from the staff stepping in to help these people out and make sure that we could wait for our bill without being harassed. My advice for anyone wanting to visit this place is to enjoy the atmosphere, the food, and drinks but just make sure you eat fast to avoid being harassed by impatient out of towners.\n",

There is a difference between overcooked pasta and beyond overcooked mush. My 'pasta' was in an unrecognizable glob. I could barely pick up a noodle and strongly considered asking for a spoon because it was moreso the consistency of pudding. The rest of my table had the same issues.

He apologized and I am not going to be a d*ck when someone apologizes hence the 2 stars but it went downhill from there....really fast. P.S.

And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I would like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers do not sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Then, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area would not have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I would intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they are all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she would not oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just did not want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n",

            "My whole issue really is that they do not seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they do not make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I have walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it is not crowded.  I would not recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you are going to get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it is too much of a gamble.\n",

After we all settled in and ordered it took almost 90 minutes for our food to arrive. No apologies, no warning, and from the looks of the restaurant there was no reason for the delay.

I AM GOING TO everything tasted the same. The portions were also pretty small considering some of the entrees cost $18 to $25. That all said, the quality was pretty good.

I tried to bite it, but could not because it was so floppy and soggy that I had to strain my neck in order to get it into my mouth. It was literally bent at a ninety degree angle in my hand. I would even venture to say that the dough was raw, except for the edge crust and the toppings were sliding off. I actually had to put it back into my oven to make it edible. I took photos as well because I am shocked at how terrible this pizza was. It was equivalent to eating a beef flavored, lukewarm wet towel.

Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!!

The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we did not like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kind of took the fun out of the ride.\n",

The rye bread lacked substance, unfortunately like most bread in the Boston area except for Iggy's, but Iggy's does not make real Jewish rye bread..  Finally, the matzo ball soup was only fair.  The broth was the best part of the meal, and the matzo balls were no bad, but not great.  The matzo balls were strangely very white, as if some especially underrbaked matzo had been used to make the matzo meal.   The pickle tasted like it had never had contact with garlic.  \n",

The kale came in a fish sauce, which was ill-conceived. As the kale sat in the sauce it became soggy, and after about five minutes it was inedible.  The dish also included pieces of thick cut bacon, which was delicious unless you happened to get a piece with any fat on it.  The pieces with fat had soaked up so much of the smoke flavoring that it was like a tiny Chuck Norris inflicting pain on my tongue.  To his credit, our waiter noticed how little of the dish we ate, and removed it from our bill without us even mentioning it. \n",

There was no need for a palate cleanser between the shrimp and the mushroom ragu, because the ragu was dominated by the same oil.  The panna cotta was a little gritty, but otherwise pretty standard.\n",

For two relatively plain burgers, and fries I am walking out with $30 check, and to me that is too much for what we were served.\n",

There was about two weeks between my visits and both times it was blamed on the new chef changing the menu, though the plates are pretty basic and do not seem to have changed much (according to those I was with that regularly go here) from the previous menu. The first time I went it was with a group of coworkers (5 of us on a Thursday) on our lunch hour. We were the only ones besides a man at the bar, maybe a few on the upper level but I honestly did not see. Waited a solid 30-35 minutes for food with no apology or explanation, so finally one of us asked and they said \"it is a new menu and our kitchen is still learning it.\" Not ideal, but definitely understandable. I had the chicken quesadilla and it came with rice and beans and a side of queso; all were AWESOME. Had to scarf it down but it was so good. \n",
            "The second visit was less impressive. Met some friends on a Sunday for brunch and they had already gotten queso and a pitcher of margaritas when we arrived, the waiter saw us sit and came over to bring water. After that we did not hear from him for about 15 minutes. We asked about the wait and it was blamed on the new menu/chef yet again. Finally got to order & my husband and I split the fajitas, again they were not super busy and the food took about 20-25 minutes to come out. He did not bring our beans and rice and only brought 3 tortillas. When we asked for more tortillas and the rest of our meal, as well as a pitcher of beer, he assured us he would have it right out. Another 15 minutes goes by and he arrives with the beer (by that point we had already picked through the fajita plate and eaten most of it with chips since the likelihood of the tortillas coming was not great) and then said \"oh! Your beans and rice.\" Still never got them. \n",

I even tried the beef noodle soup, which is bland and salty. On top of that, the lady behind the counter is rude and mean! She kept on staring at me, which made my meal even more unappetizing.

But when seated in the dining room there was a completely different menu. When we asked about the sandwiches we were told we needed to go to the TAP room.  They would NOT allow us to eat in the dining room. Now the food comes from the same kitchen and the TAP room was full. So they just lost business for the evening.  Too bad... we were all on expense accounts...\n",

It is never wonderful anymore.  The last time I was here, it was the worst I have ever had . . . I would say just here, but I cannot think of a time it was worse anywhere.  It was watery, there was very little cheese and half of it did not have any of their sauce on it.

They said it was us and decided to maybe It was your children(we do not have any children) and was very rude.. No one took the blame. He then asked if we had gone to McDonald at night because the check in check out said we did and we did not. Which means someone there used our car for their own pleasure..

My question is, if you only get 5 of these (1.25 each) and if full price (not happy hour) is 9 bucks, then you get the same amount of only 5 wings? If so then it is a total rip. even the happy hour wings is a total rip. the 50 cent Tuesday deal seems more like it, but if the 'happy hour wings' are 6 bucks and you only get 5 then what gives? If the 'regular priced' wings 'if' (and I say if becuase I have no idea) you get more for 9 bucks, then the happy hour price really is not a happy hour deal then is it? If the regular 9 dollar deal is say 10 wings, then if you get 5 for 6 bucks at happy hour, all they are doing is shorting you the wings! Happy hour means, you get the same amount as full price not a half portion! And what is up with the rest of the wing? The other part of the wing has more meat than some of these drummets do.\n",

To our dismay, housekeeping did not bother to come in and change bedding/towels while we were gone, so after a very long day, we came back to a dirty room and no towels. Quite annoying. Not to mention that we were lured in right after checking in with the promise of a \"welcome packet\", which contained a bunch of pretty useless 10% off and/or free drink/appetizer with the purchase of $25 type of coupons, and were suckered into listening to a sales pitch for 3 hours. We were informed during said pitch that this particular resort will be undergoing renovations soon, but I certainly hope they get their act together on the housekeeping front regardless!

            "The entire \"Dine\" show is only a few minutes.  After everyone is done eating, and Believe has ended, one whale comes into the pool near Dine and the trainer has it swim up to the side so guests can take pictures.  That is about it.  No questions, no interaction with the trainer, just one quick photo op.  \n",

            "Considering the few patrons in, we expected the service to be quick. However, we waited over 20 minutes for our appetizers- a few salads and an order of calamari. Our entrees took another 25 minutes. I got the fish and chips, at the recommendation of the waitress who said it was a customer favorite. I have never been so disappointed. The crust was thick, the fish not fresh, and the fries soggy. My friend ordered the burger, which, thankfully they could not do much to mess up. You can get better food for cheaper at a 99 or Fuddruckers. All around mediocre to sub-par. \n",

            "The food was good, decor/ambiance was great so why two stars? The service was terrible. We went for a friend's birthday, there was seven of us and we took turns arriving for our reservation. Each of us were literally pointed to our table by the hostess who informed us \"That is your table.\" I thought I was the only one since I came in alone but the others in my party told me she did it to them too. On top of that the waitress took forever to take our orders for drinks and our meals and then the manager had to come clear our table when she saw us waiting, provided us with our bill, and got us to go boxes which took about 30 minutes because she had no help from our waitress, ridiculous. She was sweet but, we all felt bad that she was doing everything on her own. This was my second time here and I figured we would give it a second shot since my friend wanted to try somewhere new for her birthday but, it was no better than my first experience.\n",

The Manager explained that the truck never showed up, so there were no juices or biscuits.  Everything was the same as when you go for lunch, except there were waffles and eggs.  I have a feeling that it is not a great breakfast most of the time, because there were very few people there.  \n",

            "\n",
            "When we started picking up the sushi, it fell apart immediately. It was not pressed hard enough so the rice did not stick together. Realized that is why it came out that fast.. they basically put in half the effort. It was not a very well presented platter as half the toppings were scattered around the actual sushi. Half the sushi was falling apart as we tried to pick it up with our chopsticks. A bit disappointing as I have had good experiences with Green Leaf Sushi in the past with their sushi quality. \n",

            "I heard great things about posto. But it was pretty disappointing. The calamari was not fresh at all (really fishy taste) and the breading was thick. The gnocchi with short rib was not cooked properly because parts of the sauce were still under cooked. It was also salty but not as much as the pizza. The pepperoni pizza was so salty I had to take some pepperoni off just to be able to eat it. For the price and lousy quality, will not be coming back\n",
            "Vegetarian options lack distinction.  Great drink selection, but I will not be going back for food unless something changes on the menu- which is rather unfortunate given how close the location is.  This afternoon I tried the Elephant Walk's omelet on french bread and my husband had the portabello pudding.  Both were okay I suppose, but nothing exciting and certainly did not provide a compelling reason to return.\n",
            "Since I live in the neighborhood, I really want this place to succeed. Beautiful space. The 1/4 chicken portion was small. Who thinks rotisserie chicken is tastier than roasted chicken? Not me. Why not add fried chicken to the menu, too? The French fries were lame and the slice of bread reminded me of a slice of store bought white bred with a little something in it. And If I want water to drink, do not make me drink it from a tiny plastic cup. Roasted beets were good, but they looked like they came out of a can with a dollup of goat cheese on it.... I can do that! Also, the price point is not something I am willing to pay very often. The manager needs to have confidence and act like she owns the place. Granted, it was the first day they opened and I will give it another chance.\n",
            "Very very poor. The food was good, but everything else was a mess. We felt ignored from the moment we got there. Several tables after we arrived were taken care of before us (we were only four). The drinks were misleading from the menu (a 1oz whisky is actually a mixed drink). And then after we left and looking at the receipt I noticed we were charged for a $14 drink that we never ordered (my fault for not examining the receipt while paying). Overall, just a crappy experience. We will not be back.\n",
            "Hey they got $7 pitchers of coors or molson. I stop in before I head over for a Bruin or Sox game. A few times for a concert at the Orpheum. I think the food is servered simply so they do not send people out into the streets as drunk as they could get firing them down in here.  If your with a group and its busy enough that you end up upstairs you better not be in a hurry to get anywhere fast.\n",
            "My experience with the Bee Cave location was from an afternoon at the barn. Had been craving their pesto pasta with chicken, stopped by for a ToGo order... I felt that was more appropriate then sitting at a table with the essence of eau de equine on my person. \n",

Filled with lots of different options for varying palates. I decided on the \"chefs special\" which was clams and mussels in a white wine sauce. It was overly salty and covered in some fried potatoes or onions which really did not make sense with the dish. I just picked them off and put them aside. \n",

Finally she said if we were interested in a table, she would get someone else to help us. Huh? Why would she not be able to seat us and why would she not offer all options upfront? So we waited for the 2nd guy, who took us to a table then made us walk back to the front because he had not checked to make sure it was actually ready. Other than that he was pleasant.\n",

We love small plates but please, explain either on the menu or to the customer when ordering how big or small things are - i.e., for these people should order 2 so each person could have their own skewer. We got the chicken meatball (yes that is singular) which we had to cut in half. Without sauce it had no flavor, and with it, it was like drinking a bottle of soy sauce in just one bite, that is how salty it was. Yikes. We got one bao bun (again, not easily shareable, tell people to order two) which the meat innards were quite tasty but the bun itself seemed a bit undercooked as it was soggy.\n",

I have a sensitive tummy and when my husband bit into it he was in serious pain, so he called over another waitress (because after our original served us she disappeared and every time we tried to signal her she did not seem to see us...which was an indicator of things to come, unfortunately).  This new lady started out by telling us \"oh it is only 1 in 10 peppers that are that hot\" (as if somehow after burning his mouth the first time he is going to want to take another bite) but agreed to take it back and get us tempura instead. \n",

Our original waitress never came back, and when you are sitting at the table for 10-15 minutes, drinks long finished, no food on the table, water almost gone, and no one comes by to at least get you a refill or let you know when your last food item would be arriving, you get a bit frustrated - especially as you are so hungry and she said we could order in stages! We had wanted to order the burger next that was recommended - which by the way was $14 plain or $19 with bacon and a fried egg, so we were planning to share as there is no way in hell we would be paying $30-40 for two burgers) but never got the chance.\n",

She came back and said the order would be on the house and apologized. We also let her know that the guy standing right by our table had made us super uncomfortable, and that we love Bamboo as a whole but this experience tonight was pretty bad.

They gave my friend truffles, a birthday card signed by the staff, and a $25 gift card for her birthday...that is awesome! All of that being said however...I will not be going back, simply because other restaurants in the area offer a more creative menu, better ambience, an absolute wow factor on taste on all menu items (Kres), and for about $20 less on average per person.

We were seated and server was nice but the food came out very slowly. Food itself was average, best part was the table Focaccia bread. Veal picatta was fine, bruschetta was totally soaked, wife barely touched her pasta, kids meal was very average cold pizza. Needless to say we will not whim to return again.

I cannot really comment on wait times and such because we did not even attempt to get a lane. Oh and the valet sucks! Its mandatory valet- which I already hate.- and upon arrival it is not super clear where to go for valet.

While waiting to be seated, I noticed the health inspection certificate on the wall with a score of 82 which made me wonder what had happened to cause that.  I am used to seeing scores in the high 90s.  We were promptly seated, and our wait person came to talk to us.  My wife had brought a Scout Mob savings voucher, but she had neglected to read that it excluded weekends.  When she told the wait person she had this voucher, we both thought the wait person's tone became rather condescending.  We happen to like using Groupon or Scout Mob certificates because they allow us to try a restaurant without having to pay the regular pricing.  If we are disappointed, we do not feel as bad about what we have spent.

We asked the wait person what suggestions he might have about what to order as we were first timers.  He suggested a few appetizers and entrees.  We went with his suggestion of the brussels sprouts for the appetizer.  My wife decided on the suggested fried chicken and I chose the shrimp and grits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The appetizer and then the entrees came within a reasonable wait period, and they looked appealing.  The brussels sprouts were good but nothing special.  They had a special sauce or coating on them, but my wife is a good cook and could easily have made this at home.  Her fried chicken with green beans, slaw, and mashed potatoes was OK but it did not blow her socks off.  She could easily have made this at home.  In fact, we were talking later that it would have been just as good at any chain restaurant for about half the cost.  As for my shrimp and grits, they were neither the best nor worst I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot.  The best I have ever eaten were at Husk in Charleston.  Article 14 in Midtown also has some great shrimp and grits.\n",

I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $5 for the lavas bread (what was I suppose to eat with the dips).  Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.\n",

It is a blight on Salem and inexcusable they do not take responsibility for this.\n",

Today, our waitress was very busy and we had empty drink cups for a while, so when the manager walked by, we asked if he would fill them. He said \"sure\", but never brought us drinks. We then see him lapping the restaurant looking for her, to notify her. Any good Manager would have jumped in and helped their staff. Pure laziness! Great waitress, poor management.\n",
            "Pho Hoa has trouble slicing its meats so that their thicknesses match the type of cut. For example, rare flank steak should generally be pretty thin, so that it has a good chance of cooking while sitting in the soup. (But probably not shabu-thin). In the bowls I have had at Pho Hoa though, 4 of 4 times my bowls of pho were not only served lukewarm, but the rare flank was not able to cook thoroughly. That was because it was cut way too thickly and because of the soup temperature. Tonight I also nearly chocked and gagged on the bubble tea I ordered: The bubbles were rock hard and not really cooked, and the ratio of heavy cream to tea was so high that the taste of black tea was nowhere to be found. With Pho Thien Thien and Xinh Xinh just around the corner, I see no reason to go to Pho Hoa for the beef pho. (PH's pork chops are another matter; they are really good!). Two stars. I would give another half-star for the diplomacy served up by the waiters to this couple behind me who could not understand that PH does not serve wontons as part of their pho.\n",

I had pizza, which was frankly a soggy, limp mess. Toppings slid off, it seemed watery, and it was not hot (which would at least explain the toppings sliding off). The ingredients tasted good enough, but it was not at all satisfying to eat. My wife's meal seemed kind of small for the cost, and while she said it was good it was not good enough to justify the cost to portion size. The chocolate gelati was, to me, indistinguishable from chocolate ice cream, but it cost $6. The Lavazza coffee was better than the average watered-down brown water at most places, but was still over priced and no refill!\n",

            "BOOOOO!!!  I used to wait tables at a Papa Razzi almost 8 years ago and it had the same menu but just felt classier.  This one (right on the Wellesley border) the food was ok, but not great service.  We were the ONLY ones (most of the time) at the bar having dinner, drinks and watching Bruins.  The bartender did not seem to care about getting us anything.  We had none of the famous focaccia bread, but by the time we realized our meals were already out.  She never asked if our meal was good, if we wanted another round, desert, nothing!!  I was shocked, especially since the more we spend the better tip she gets.  I left her 20% only because I used to wait tables, but my bf wanted to leave not much.  Really sad because food is still great!\n",
            "Went here for a gyro, not very much meat, WAY too much lettuce, and you could tell the tzatziki sauce was made with sour cream and not Greek yogurt. The best part about this place was the fries. Would not suggest if you want a good gyro.\n",
            "Great place for some, but I have a hard time understanding the long lines at lunch time and regularly crowded parking lot. I do not think they use seasoning other than salt and pepper in most of their dishes, which for the demographic they serve seems to have worked well, but if you are looking for more interesting food, go across the train tracks to Local No. 7.\n",

            "Empty when we arrived, confused wait staff. Happy hour, assumed the pizza on the menu singled out was the happy hour item (at 18$?) and it was not. The happy hour item was like jalapeño, sprouts, string cheese and some other hipster jazz. Naw thanks. Question, how big is the pizza? Enough for two? Yes, we were assured. We have a three year old so ordered a kids pizza (the menu has the same items listed twice, and if you have kids maybe eat somewhere else) which was 8-9\", massive for a child. The rest of the pizzas are maybe 14\"? So you pay 75% more for 25% more pizza. Pretty sure the crispy potatoes and prosciutto were made with seasoning from ramen, super dry, no cheese or sour cream....parched! It needed something to kick it up. Anyway, the pizza, the main event. We ordered the Tasso, sounds great, like a high end hawaiian. Crust is fine, overall though super thin and weak. Seems like they put around an 1/8th of a lb of cheese sporadically and toppings, we were starving a half hour later. This is snowflake food, for those who do not know how to cook. Oh, hmm, noice I love the pickled onion roots and green boiled strawberries, did you know those are local? Yeah that is what I heard. Took forever to finally get the check, had to walk up and get er done. They will get better, I know it! The cider on bottle is awful by the way, tastes like bud light with apple juice, I recommend something on tap or nothing.  Tell you what though, the pizza sauce was pretty good, could not imagine getting heart there.\n",

            "This place really is not good. Teriyaki chicken had the consistency of rubber. Sushi rolls were not made as described. They did not put in 4 of our orders and then did not do anything to fix it. One of the waitresses had a horrible temperament and had to be flagged down each time we needed her. To top it all off, they did not seat us promptly even though we were first on the list to get a table--they seated others who came in after us. The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the fried rice and the all-you-can-eat price. Probably will not return.\n",

Coffee was weak and watery. Never did get refills unless we continuously waved down our server. I got one egg bacon and home fries. Home fries were greasy with no flavor. Egg was the same way. Got a pancake to try. It was big but flat and chewy. Told the waitress that it did not taste good but she did not do much to try and fix the problem. Oh well it was worth a try but that was a one time\n",

I believe the ratings are higher due to lack of options, however I truly feel that this place would border very average in a more experienced Italian region. I know that I am in the minority, but my veal saltimbocca was salty and somewhat tuff. The bolognese was had a good amount of meat but was a little acidic for my liking.

We have probably frequented Neptune about 50 times so we are not shy of spending money for a great meal. By saying that Select is SO over priced.

I could not understand how they could serve those to customers. The waitress did not even say sorry. She was rushing us and not friendly. The crab legs were ok not the best taste I have ever had. Lobster was nothing like we had in Maine(undercooked) . Brother in law and friends were happy with their alfredo children and shrimp scampi.

After about 20 mins, there was no visible wait staff - while the hostesses chatted it up.  The manager finally comes over after busing a table with dirty dishes in one hand to take our drink order.  Our overworked, bubbly waitress eventually surfaces to take our food order.  Food is served and we dig in.   Ketchup requested at the onset is not delivered until omelet is halfway consumed.  No raw sugar for the coffee.  Grit croutons served with the Caesar Salad - WTF?  Several little things prevent this spot from being top notch.  But \"its the little things that count\", right?  All in all, the food was \"okay\" not good.  $40+ for an omelet and salad &  2 coffees.  The place suffers from \"poor staffing\" not \"under staffing\".  YOU could not make sense of the 3 hostesses and 1 waitress staffing model.  But who am I? (lol) Time will tell if this lives up to the hype generated by the lines at the front door.

I ordered medium rare and what arrived was  a solidly grey sad looking burger that looked like it had been forgotten on the grill.  I sent it back and a new one arrived slightly more pink but not much better tasting.  The bun was bigger than the meat.  Mint, you just cannot get away with a shitty burger in a town like Portland.

I have to eat gluten free and by the time I got home I had a huge rash all over my throat. I am not that sensitive so it had to have been a LOT of soy sauce or something in the food. I mentioned needing gluten free everything at least 4 times to the waiter.

Hers had a very similar sauce as my appetizer, but the sauce seemed even thicker. I was disappointed with my chicken, it was really tough to cut into. We ordered Tiramisu for desert, which was tasty, but way too small a portion for $7.  Service was also a challenge. It got busy around 7:30, and the wait staff was stretched thin.  It took longer than we would have liked for our main courses to come out, and service after that slowed to a crawl. It took over 5 minutes to bring us the desert menu after asking. When we got the check, I put in an extra $20, and asked for it to be broken so I could leave a tip. The waiter returned with 2 $10s, while I was expecting $10,$5,5x$1.

The butternut squash soup was tasty, but too thick for my taste.  The ciabatta sandwiches my daughter and I got were meh - I am just not a fan of this scrape-the-top-of-my-mouth-off bread craze.  To me it is just the inability or lack of care in keeping it fresh and moist enough.  The fillings: bland.  But the worst part of the whole experience was the Roman salad my wife ordered.  Wilted, brown-around-the-edges lettuce, somewhat dry chicken, sauce that might as well be plopped out of a can, all on the side - the salad itself not seasoned at all.

My boyfriend ordered the extra wine pairing with his meals and the pour was not generous, it was not even half full. The dessert I received was mediocre as well, it was a mix of custard with grapefruit, weird on the pallet, the chocolate mouse my boyfriend ordered was good.

Food came, and my burger was missing the horseradish sauce I requested (was completely dry). My fried egg yolk was completely cooked, but the whites were runny. Is not the whole point of paying the extra $1 for the runny yolk? Both burgers ordered were over cooked and the fried chicken livers were warm at best. While this used to be our go to spot for a burger, the excellent customer service and attention to detail seem to have slowly faded over the past year.\n",

After all, there is no longer any promotional value to it.  Apparently, not here.

I like tomatoes, and I like water, but whether it is a sauce, soup, cream soup, confit, compote, or tomato margarita you aim to make, the terrifying reality is that you will need more than those two ingredients, and one of the elements you will need is time.  As this is the sole soup on the menu, its thundering crappiness is yet the more lamentable.

But, that crushing truth notwithstanding, the fact is that when I previously have - in this life, not the next sublime one - ordered a grilled cheese, special or otherwise, in nearly all previous circumstances, the cheese portion has generally been uniformly applied to a minimum of 75/80 percent. coverage. Additionally, in past encounters  with this species I have noted that the general practice seems to be that some sort of lipid (butter, oil, margarine: I really do not care!) is applied to the outside, upon which the whole is set upon heat for some time and then turned, with the obvious effect of heating the sandwich from two sides with a heat conductant on either, thereby melting the innards. I regret to say the sandwich, while gently heated, had no oil of any sort applied, and that the cheese (on the half with cheese) remained staunchly unmelted.\n",

We sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon- bartender was quick to put in our drink order- we had to aggressively flag her down after about 15 minutes to take our food order. All my friend and I ordered were two soups and edamame. Over the following 35 minutes we watched others who had arrived after us being served food and noticed a lot of yelling. One manager even vocalized \"if  XYZ is the case you are all fired\" right in front of the entrance with waiting customers. Once the bartender saw how clearly irritated we were she asked two separate runners to check on our food without even consoling us or telling us she was going to see what happened. Before anything else we asked her to remove the food because we still had not gotten it. She proceeded to complain to her employees in front of us about how frustrated she was that no one would run her food- while we waited her to run our card. We almost left without paying.\n",

There is much better food, including Thai, within an easy walk.\n",

I go with my friend and get seated right away with our menus. We sit at our table for a solid 10 min before our all-star waitress arrives and greets us with \"Do you know what you want?\" We order our food and then ask if its possible to get something to drink also, because that step was skipped right over. Our food actually comes fairly quickly and again is very good. I got the chocolate chip pancakes which were awesome and my friend got one of the omelets, which she said was good. Our food was brought by another server because our waitress was too busy receiving a shoulder massage from another worker, a lot of heavy lifting for her that day. After we finished our food, Captain America dropped off the check as she breezed by to pretend to do some work at another table. I felt like leaving any tip at all would be a gross over payment, but I was foolishly talked into leaving 5%.

We arrived a little after 7:00 on a Saturday night,expecting it to be busy.

The hostess obliged and allowed us to sit at one of the empty tables in the bar area after we explained that we would not be ordering entrees, just apps and drinks.  The waiter was very hurried,asked us what we would like to order for dinner  before we were even given a menu! We explained that we would like drinks and appetizers only, and that we were not familiar with Indian food  at all ( Hint!-help us out here)-I was expecting he might explain some items on the menu or ask what we like -seafood,vegetables,spicy,etc..offer a suggestion... but this was not the case. Away he ran, only to come back and once again ask what we wanted to order, and what we wanted to order for entrees, so once again I had to remind him that we were not ordering entrees.

Bread was not even available to me until 20 min after sitting down. The boys shared their food with me and we continued waiting. When they finally brought my food, after I had watched people seated way after us receive their food, the server tried to not even acknowledge that it was extremely late.

The roll they bring you beforehand was pretty standard but the basil/chive butter they give is really good.  We felt really awkward because it was about 5pm-ish and there were a ton of servers all standing around staring at you as you eat or talk.  It made for a very awkward dining experience.  Oh yeah and we both got water and it was *terrible*....WATER.  There was some funky undertone and we thought it was the glass.

I took a bite and I swear to you if someone had blindfolded me and fed this to me, I would have said I was eating Chef-Boy-Ardee's Beef Ravioli.  I mean from the texture to the taste to the smell it was like they popped open a can of that stuff and made it into a lasagna.

Having multiple staff members stop by and say \"oh let me go check on that\" and never returning with the dish we again get up to check on the order....

They accused me of being a liar, reprinted my receipt to prove it, and were rude to me in front of other customers, offering no solution. I would have gladly paid extra for the meat, and thought I had. All this caused by their staff getting my order wrong, which is apparently the customers fault. Please check your receipt, and be clear when you order, because if there is a problem with your order it will not be resolved. Needless to say I would rather walk 100 ft to Halal Bros or Miltos who have equally good gyro meat until their service improves.\n",

Almost to the point of overwhelming (perhaps spoiled even) As for the rice and cabbage that is where the 2 stars stop! The lamb was underwhelming and a bit over cooked. I am a medium to medium-well type chick and I get they do not accommodate to that extent,  but well done is a no-no!!! Also the red oil was seeping through my bag and got everywhere!

What is more, when I was there, it was really nice out, and with all of the windows and doors open, it was really comfortable.

We were seated right away but we had to request a move because the overhead heating vent was blasting on us  We moved to another table next to the large plate glass window which looked like it had not been cleaned all winter.  There was gray film from top to bottom.  There were no tablecloths on any of the wood tables, which looked like they were never polished.  The waitress was pleasant and gave prompt attention.  Food came out quickly but got mixed reviews.  My wife's chicken cacciatore was quite good, but my chicken parm with ziti was overcooked.  The chicken was tough and the ziti was falling apart.  Two sodas and a glass of house wine came to $12.00. Sounds high. Finally, after paying our bill, my wife reported that the bathroom had nothing to dry hands.

Due to heavy work travel I have not been able to enjoy my favorite bbq spot. So, I decided to visit and order the same ole chicken dinner, to only find that they no longer served chicken with bone...WHAT? The only types of chicken that is available is Sliced or Chopped- That is IT! I was told, it was not popular...which is hard to believe- it is chicken!  \n",

I tried an orange creamsicle one, and my friend had a chocolate one. I was very disappointed in the taste. The orange creamsicle one tasted completely artificial. It was also not very sugary...which I guess some people like, but it is a dessert. The chocolate cream was done better. It had a sort of richness to it. The puff itself was a letdown. It was not at all sugary...it also tasted kind of dry. It seemed like the focus was purely on the cream...which was not done well in the orange creamsicle case. \n",

Yet, we must have sat ourselves in a vortex...there almost 10 minutes with servers walking by our table, even bumping our chairs, and not a single greeting. It is like our table was not assigned to anyone so no one bothered to help us. It got awkward, then a little funny, then we finally stopped someone to see if they were our server. Were told one would be right with us...then a few more minutes. Just got off to a bad start, then the food was not very good and the beer selection is mainly limited to the Bud variety. With so many options around town, the new kid on the block did not make a very good first impression.\n",

            "We used to be regulars when it used to be Grumpy Doyle's. Since the name change, they have removed a lot of great items off of the menu and all that remains is very basic non-pub style food. We went in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was dead. After sitting at the bar for a few minutes and getting some sodas, we realized that we would not be eating there. I completely understand simplifying the menu and doing a few things really well instead of having a lot of items that are just OK, but I found the menu to be really basic and disappointing. We did not check what was on tap so I am not sure if the beer selection has been expanded or changed. If they offer a good selection of craft and micro brews, I might be back to have a few beers occasionally.\n",
            "I have ordered a lot of take-out from this place and I have finally learned...the place just is not getting better.  The last time i ordered from them I could not even eat the food because it smelled like canned dogfood.  The spring rolls are good, but the potstickers really are not.   A lot of their food is bland.\n",

I ordered roast pork with white rice, sweet plantains, and tostones. EVERYTHING was overcooked and no flavor. The sweet plantains were very hard and the tostones were soggy. Staff looked overwhelmed. I will never go back. Not good quality food for the price you have to pay.\n",

The dumplings were probably the best part of the meal, although that did not say much. The dipping sauce was just soy sauce with sugar added. The lo mein lacked any serious flavor, and all of the chicken was covered in fat. You would think they could have trimmed it at least?  The orange beef was seriously disappointing. It was soggy, and bland, and the sauce (which was only on about half of the dish) did not taste anything like an orange peel dish should. It lacked spice and balance, as it was just thick and sugary. \n",

Notwithstanding one meal was good, the second and last time I ordered there I ordered lo mein which was a good size but my god the noodles tasted like it was cooked in a pan after week old trout. The fishy taste was horrific and overwhelming and the really bad part is that I did not order seafood lo mein and I hate fish. Needless to say it was a one star meal. \n",

Also ordered a salad that was definitely a bag of lettuce with some chopped chicken strips tossed in a little ranch dressing.  Nothing else memorable or worth highlighting food wise.  Ambience was fair and the tunes blasting throughout the place were good.  Needless to say, the proximity of the restaurant was it is only redeeming quality.\n",
            "It was not my best experience. The decorations were very nice and did seem to reflect the authenticity of Mexico but the food did not. I tried the torta, the Chicago burrito, the flan and two tacos of al pastor and carnitas. Overall the meat was bland and the prices are seriously exaggerated. I know taco trucks and other Mexican restaurants that charge $1 for their tacos.. ONE DOLLAR and they are the best I have tried! I mean it was not bad but it was not the greatest. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am originally from California where the true Mexican food is & I am Mexican and have been eating real Mexican food all my life, this place is just not up to par. I will not be coming back.\n",
            "I was recently at the Peabody for a convention across the street. While the location is great/very convenient, I was not impressed by the customer service. The in-room wifi Internet (which you pay for) did not work and it took numerous calls down to both the front desk and IT department to have someone actually attempt to help with the issue.  The ultimate \"resolution\" on their end was that it must be my computer, versus their network.  However, the wifi worked fine on my computer in all other locations, just not the room.  As a business traveler that needs to rely on internet accessibility while on the road, I will most likely elect to stay at a different hotel due to this experience if I have another convention at the Orange County Convention Center.\n",
            "I am going to start this by saying I feel bad giving it two stars because the food was decent, and it could be a three star BUT literally it was the WORST service I have had in a long time. I went here with a small group (6) for a friends birthday last night. Our meal took 2.5 hours, not exaggerating! They sat us at an awkwardly large table (seated 12-15) and through out the entire meal the manager sat at the other end of the table and went over schedules/tip outs with each server. I have never sat at a table and had the manager sitting 3 seats down from me going over things with a calculator, talking to staff etc, do they not have an office in the back? Another table he could sit at perhaps, it was truly bizarre. \n",

The bread pudding at the end was great. \n",

Every time we do end up there hoping the service is better, we continue to leave disappointed. We will not be returning.\n",

I order the chicken and red velvet waffle sliders and the meal was okay. They were not as good as I expected them to be.  The plating of the chicken and waffles was confusing as they had a long plate with each slider on a separate end (see pic). The bathroom  was out of order which was an issue. However the food is very reasonably priced and the restaurant ambiance is cute and the Jazz is nice.\n",

Regardless, we showed up and they had several tables ready...one to seat 6 and one to seat 4.  Unfortunately, they refused to pull the tables together, it is not that they could not, it was because they did not want to, frankly, I think they were adhering to a policy at the deteriment of good customer service.

How about when you go to dinner, or to the pool, or to the Disney parks?  Nope, not allowed.  I found this out the morning of our vacation, when I called to confirm booking which was made through Hotels.com.  It does not say this anywhere on the Wyndham website or the Hotels.com website, but I was assured by the Wyndham Director of Guest Services that this is Wyndham's policy.  So we scrambled to find other arrangements for our dog on the morning of our trip, since it was too late to cancel.\n",
            "2.       We asked at check-in if we could purchase Disney theme park tickets at the hotel, to avoid the wait times at the park.  No problem, they told us the tickets at the hotel were the same price as at the parks.  However, we could save $133 on our park tickets by attending a ninety minute presentation about Wyndham time shares and we would be served free breakfast.  As it turned out, breakfast was prepackaged muffins and coffee, and the price we paid for the park tickets was over inflated.  We actually only saved $68 dollars total and the presentation was a horrible experience.  We sat there for TWO hours being interrogated with personal questions and eventually insulted for not realizing the value of investing in a time share.  Had I known what the true savings and consequences were, we would never have agreed to attend.\n",
            "3.       The hotel itself was clean and nicely appointed, with various pools and a walking trail around the lake.  However, in addition to the hotel price, they tack on $20 plus tax per night for self-parking and $20 plus tax per night for resort amenities.  So that is an extra $44 per night on top of the room price.\n",

But overall we were underwhelmed. There just was not a ton of flavor. However, we have since gone back for one thing--the tamal! It is delicious. And i had a fantastic cafe con leche. I really want to like this place more--my gf loved her cuban sandwich--but i just did not.  Maybe i ordered poorly!\n",

So we made our own sauce. We should not of bothered the rollatinis were horrible. A few trays of a mix of finger sandwiches with only 8 on each that were steal and tasted like crap.

It can easily be confused with Dua II which is just further down the street on 63 Broad St.  You will find a diverse crowd at Dua, both in terms of service staff and customers.  You order your food on the 1st floor, and then you have the option of eating in one of two dining rooms, one on the main floor and one downstairs, with the latter being much bigger & classier.  \n",

For all the things and sauces on the nachos, they were so bland. We also ordered the pretzels which were okay, except for the weird \"beer sauce\" they came in.

Unfortunately the dish was very bland. I was also pretty disappointed with my dessert. I had ordered the creme brulee trio. It was 3 small creme brulee's in raspberry, chocolate and vanilla flavor.

Guess what... after our food was dropped off our waiter never came back. We literally ate for an hour. Thank god I had the water too! I Was beyond irritated by this time. Our check came back to us and they still charged us the bottomless price. I asked the waiter to take that off since we only had one drink! It was apparently a common thing. Two other tables said the same thing before we did.

The bowling was standard but overpriced ($6.50 per person per game plus a $4 shoe rental). I think this price goes up if you are trying to bowl on a Friday or weekend night (to around $7 per person). Given that a game probably lasts about 15-20 minutes, it was a quick way to burn through some cash. The couches around the bowling alley did not seem to be very clean, and the bowling balls looked like they had been there forever.\n",

That being said, never ever go here without one of the coupons that they usually have available, and sign up for their e-mail deals and offers, because paying full price for their food just is not worth it. At the very least, you can get $5 off a $15 (or if you are luckier, $10 off $20), which is like the clearance rack of food coupons. During the last two visits I tried to order the Beer Can Chicken. When the first time proved unsuccessful (because apparently they only make a small number of these every day yet still have it as a regular item on the menu), I ordered the BBQ Chicken, I think, but clearly nothing was memorable enough to remember. It is like ordering McDonald's or Taco Bell at 2 a.m. after a night of drinking, you do not care what you eat, you just know you want food. \n",

            "The same concept applies here. In the name, \"Bar\" comes before \"Grill\", meaning come here for a drink and when you get hungry, order some food. It will probably taste better if you do it that way too. The food is not \"bad\" necessarily, it is just not memorable, nor is it worth the prices they charge without a coupon, so if you do not have one, having a few drinks before paying may help ease the pain when you get the bill. The Beer Can Chicken which I WAS able to get on my last visit (as that server told me they only make 4-6 per day?!?) was ok, I did not taste much of the beer flavor though. The side of dirty rice was bland and the guac/salsa side was confusing. I guess because they used Dos Equis beer they felt the need for Mexican-style sides? I do not know.\n",
            "\n",
            "What I do know is that the wishbone I had managed to salvage from the chicken and set aside to take with me, disappeared. The story goes, if you dry it out for a few days, then find someone to pull the other end with, both of you make a wish and whoever gets the bigger piece when pulled has their wish granted. Anyway, the wishbone was apparently snatched off the table by the server, yet when asked if he took it, he acted confused and said he took \"something\" off the table and threw it away. Funny how he managed to miss a lot of trash still left on the table. When I asked about the wishbone, he said he would go check to see if he could get it out of the trash, but came back and said they just took the trash to the dumpster. That felt like a lie.

They sat us because they did not want to make us stand around any longer.  Umm...OK?  He then began making excuses for the poor service we were about to receive and flippantly said, \"Well, we have only been open less than a week so there will be some back-up. Ha ha\".  Yes, we KNOW, but this explanation was weird.  He told us to order drinks now, as well as sides, and then order entrees later.

Yes, I know they are fried and, quite frankly, I like some grease.  But, I had one bite of a tot and it tasted like it was all grease - the grease was just floating around in my mouth.

The fish was remarkably bland (again, no salt, and no salt on the table, either, for me to fix it) and the malt vinegar/tartar sauce combo was not enough to salvage it.

The first bite of the falafel was very good (it was the hottest of the burgers I tried by far) but when it cooled down just a little bit, it was bland and became very mushy.  I like a grainier falafel texture and this one did not have it.  Additionally, I would have ordered this as my main entrée (and avoided that codpiece nightmare) if our Flipster (flippant hipster server) had bothered to inform us of the burger of the day.

I love pistachio but the flavor was drowned by this horrible chemical burnt plastic flavor.  Awful.  When we told the Flipster, he flippantly said he did not know how that could happen (no apologies and he seemed to not believe us).  And later, after we would paid and tipped, he asked for feedback (he said he cared) and we finally decided to point out that there were two small pieces of metal shard in one of the milkshakes (not in any way excusable).

See hungry just thinking about it and for you love of god the waitress did not know what I was talking about. I even pulled up the website and still no idea so long story short we left. Friendly people and clean bathroom would make me come and try again.\n",

The space is so great, and it is so close to my house, that I wish I could like it - but save for one or two people - interacting with the staff actually makes your day worse, not better. They apparently have forgotten they work in  \"customer service\", where you are supposed to actually serve the customer, not act like you are doing them a favor.  And I should know, I work in customer service.  It is not always easy, but that is the job.  So, if you do not like it, get another job!  Thanks :)\n",

I had to wash most of the food down by drinking a bunch of glasses of water. I am giving this place a two star due to the bread and quality of the pasta quality.  Fillings, sauce, overcooked shrimp is all a no go for me.

            "Disappointed with our third visit.  Met my friend here after the lunch hour, so there were very few diners left. It took 40 minutes to receive our appetizer. When we finally did, the grilled avocado was cold and hard to cut. The entree of grilled salmon was a nice size, but was raw throughout. We asked for the manager and she was taken aback by how undercooked our meal was, the amount of time we would waited for it, plus the lack of attention we would received throughout. She replaced and comped the avocado. She also had a third, nicer cut of salmon cooked for us when she saw the second piece was very small. In the end, it was a long and frustrating experience, and we felt we had to work to receive a lunch that merited the price. Thankfully, the manager was very sweet, otherwise it would have been a one star experience.\n",

Ordered at the counter, cashier was friendly. She told me I could order a drink from the bar through the ordering line, so I did. Ticket printed at 4:11 pm. No drink arrived. I asked an employee walking around dining room what I should do, \"do you guys bring drinks over or do I go to bar to get my drink?\" The employee told me she will bring it when it comes up. Its been ten minutes already.\n",
            "I wait two more minutes and walk up to bar and ask the bartender. She then walks over to the service bar area where my drink is sitting with ice melting. She apologizes and tells me its shift change. Funny, there are employees sitting at bar being serviced just fine. And there are six employees eating and joking around the dining room. The manager walks by and is not aware of any if this, how is that? Poor service execution and lack of awareness. Its unfortunate. The male runner or server in the dining room, greeted me after I was seated 15 minutes. Not heightened time awareness in this place. Good burgers and better service are available elsewhere - $25 lesson learned. I tipped at the cashier, am I am supposed to tip at the table too? The concept and brand needs some tweaking but has good potential. I counted nine paying guests in the dining room. It appears the employees are getting taken care of just fine. What about the paying guests? Where does the salaries, rent, and supplies come from? I could only imagine labor, COGS and controllables here. Disappointed.\n",

Plus it only came with green beans no side salad or mash potatoes, those were extra. One would think for $38 per plate the steak would just melt in your mouth and would come with more choices of side dishes.

It had been a long day at work, and so I was talked into ordering a pitcher of Sangria, and it was unpalatable at best. It tasted extremely tinny, and when I stirred it around a bit to investigate, the scant, minuscule pieces of fruit were deeply stained as if they had been sitting around for a while. It was the kind of drink you take a sip of, cringe, then follow with a sip of water. When we probed a bit with the server, he said that they pre-soak their fruit, but could not really explain the tinny flavour. \n",
            "\n",
            "Margaritas were a slight improvement. The food, however, was equally as bad. I was not really eating, but tried bites here and there and was extremely unimpressed. The salsa that accompanied the quesadilla had a strange flavour that I could not identify, and basically just consisted of a bunch of mealy, diced tomato pieces. The burrito was on special with the purchase of a drink, and was advertised as coming with rice and beans on the side. The rice and beans that accompanied the burrito amounted to like, two tablespoons of each side, but perhaps that was best, as the rice tasted like some kind of Uncle Ben's instant bistro mix, and the beans were way too salty. I did not try the burrito itself. \n",

And since we were seated at like 6:55 p.m., that meant I was left with domestics at $4.00 per bottle. While I rarely complain about prices, this is just the absolute worst.

The husband thought it was okay, I thought it was gross. So go figure. At either rate, nothing to write home about. The waiter inexplicably brought us some \"creamy jalapeno dip\" (which we did not order) which was just ranch dressing. Like, I tasted no flavor outside of ranch dressing. While the husband insisted it \"had a little kick to it,\" you could achieve the same effect by adding a dash  of hot sauce to a cup of ranch dressing. 0/5 on this, would not sample again. They do have a nacho/salsa bar option before 7:00 pm from what I understand, but since we do not have kids and are not in our 70s, we do not usually eat before then. So I cannot speak about what I have been told is a neat feature. \n",

I did highly enjoy the ranchero sauce on top, however. The side of \"Mexican rice\" was so salty as to render in inedible in my book--I rarely eat a meal that makes me want several gallons of ice water to go along with it, but this one did. It was Rice-a-Roni quality at best, which means it should be reserved for college students and not a \"made from scratch, we promise!\" type of place. After 2 bites, the rice was left for the trash. \n",

My husband and I both have a food handlers card and knew for a fact that he did not wash his hands he walked straight back there and grabbed our onion rings! My husband was so mad and disgusted he told the waiter that we were leaving and explained why and instead of the waiter actually listening he said what I do not understand is that he could have washed his hands in the back and you probably did not see it! Really you were not even watching. We went to pay for a milkshake and he still expected a tip yeah right! We left and went to eat sharis.\n",

            "I am a local Holbrook resident and I like the Brooks location not far from home however I have a few gripes with this place. The food is a tad overpriced, one example would be the mini steak tip appetizer that comes with 6 tiny steak tips the size of a dime & cost $9.95 (Not really a good appetizer to share when having drinks with friends) the steak tip dinner is $17 and though the steak tips are amazing when your looking to have drinks etc this adds up significantly. This brings me to the cost of the drinks, 1. Every bartender charges something different  as well as makes the same drink different from the other bartenders. I get a mudslide on the rocks and every one I order is a different price 2 & a different consistency. I am a very local patron & I would come in for drinks far more often than I do now if every time I left there my tab was not $80 & up with not much to show for it 3. They no longer carry twisted tea or any other bottled beverage such as Henry's Hard orange soda(big seller) or something similar therefore for someone like myself of whom does not drink beer or wine and also does not want to be forced to drink cocktails everytime, it does not entice me to stop in more often. \n",
            "Also I ordered a steak tip dinner to go & when I was ordering the bartender asked what I wanted for my sides, I asked if I could do half french fries half onion rings and was told NO!? Then was told that \"I could order a side of onion rings, that they were only a couple bucks\" I thought wow they charge $17 for a steak tip dinner and I cannot get what I want unless of course I want to add even more $$ to the bill of which was already outrageous..I think the Brook is a gold mine & the owners have the right idea but they really need to cater to their locals and holbrook residents as we are the people that will carry them through the cold winter months when things are slower & we are the ones that people ask whether we reccomend it or not but not if the prices remain as high as they are..another restaurant The Publick house just opened up around the corner and I will gladly go where I will be taken care of nutritionally & financially. My father is also a holbrook resident and likes going out and feels the same way about the brook..hopefully they will adjust things a bit.\n",

I will say it is just about the Only place in Fanueil I will go though so take that as a vote of confidence.\n",
            "I had made a pre-theatre reservation for tomorrow night and called the place today to ask a couple of questions. They offer a deal in which you can select however many of five predetermined appetizers (or five cocktails or five desserts) for $6 each at the bar until 7 pm and I thought this was a better option for us.

            "First  I would like to say we have been frequent visitors to the French Quarter Grill...and loved it. Last Friday, we decided to take some special out of town friends of ours to eat and visit since they were staying in downtown Austin..and we were from a neighboring town.   We had not seen each other.. but once since high school and were so excited to see each other. Our fathers were Japanese POWs in WWII and we were like sisters. We lived all over the country and had not gotten to see each other often but kept in touch by phone and online.  We called and again, pre-warned the restaurant, when we entered..We asked to be seated where we could visit during the evening since we were planning on staying the evening to catch up. (They were not packed...)  I had changed the venue to French Quarter from another wonderful restaurant around the corner since they loved Cajun as much as we did... \n",
            "First off, we ordered a bottle of wine and an appetizer. Since we were going for a big entree, we decided on one appetizer..Fried Green tomatoes..one of our favorites.  We were surprised..  It came out sticky, mushy, and had a very sour goo coming out of it. Not the green tomatoes we have had in the past. No one wanted the 5th tomato slice..(and I usually get an order for just me!).. \n",
            "Our waiter was a woman who had not served us in the past,  and she \"Hon\".\"Honey\"ed us to death.  Yes, Honey..Are you ready to order, HON?  No smile. Please, if you work in a nice restaurant..for that matter, any restaurant  ... please, refrain from calling people \"Honey\"..and \"Hon\"... It is not appreciated and it is annoying..(and we are from Texas! :) )  Next, came our entrees. One ordered the pork.. Husband ordered fish (very good)..The ladies..we ordered steak!  Both the guys got excellent meals...We had black hard steaks ..yes, black. Charred.. One of us ordered Medium...the other Medium well. The guys wanted to return them.  Their steaks have been amazing during past visits. I rarely order steak at restaurants because they can be iffy at best. My friend does not eat fish, so I had suggested the steaks since I knew how wonderful they have been.  I was so embarrassed...The waitress saw what they looked like..She was rude.. It is very embarrassing to bring friends, have serious food failures...and spend high dollars for food with tips $280. And we did not order desserts! We will not be back..sad how one night can change how your feel about a 'favorite' restaurant.\n",

            "#1 - The pricing on these pizzas are ridiculous and NOT worth it. We explained it was out first time there but were not really given any direction other than when selecting the cheese for the pizza we were told that to add a little shaved parmesan to the shredded cheese would count as our first topping.  We opted for a pizza with shredded mozzarella and chicken breast and then added onions and green peppers to 1/2.  To do this they charged us for \"The Big Ed\" (unlimited toppings????) which was ~$14.  The fast-cooking technique needs a little work - our pizza was not done in the center, we ate around the edges.\n",
            "#2 - \"Vernon's Meatballs\" were surprisingly decent.  They were tender and the sauce was good.\n",
            "#3 - We had issues getting regular root beer from the soda machine (one of the ones with a bunch of options to be able to combine flavors).  After 2 attempts we asked for assistance and the employee acted like we were totally disrupting their day but finally assisted and said \"well you have to press it in just the right spot and hold it down\"....OK, did not think it should be that difficult....\n",

            "After all the hype from this show being featured on Food Network, I was disappointed in the outcome. It is a quaint little diner where you can get basic breakfast food made well, great for a hangover after a late night to help you wake up and keep going about your day.  \n",

            "But, I felt like it was really overpriced for the quality and overall simplicity of the food. Two entrees, a side of grits, and one coffee for almost $30 (with tip)? For homemade biscuits (which are not the best I have ever had), scrambled eggs, grits, and bacon, all of which I can make myself? No, thanks, not unique enough for me and makes it hard to justify that kind of money. Do not get me wrong, I do enjoy those country breakfasts, but there has to be more than a TV appearance and autographed photos in the waiting area to make me want to come back.\n",

Not to mention the quality of service is similar at both locations.\n",
            "Went here for breakfast before a sports event we were going to. We had about an hour before we had to leave so figured we had plenty of time. We ordered right away and the service the whole time was truly horrible. We asked for napkins and they never came. We asked for creamer and it never came. We ended up having to take creamer from another table because it just never showed up. Then we finally get our food AFTER 45 MINUTES OF WAITING and the waitress just kept staring at us like we were being jerks. We gobbled down our food as fast as possible and ended up being 15 minutes late to our event. Food was not even that good, it was just average.\n",

            "First time we went there, we grabbed a few muffins and breakfast sandwiches and it was so good! Muffins are sliced and grilled with butter... So we went in a second time for a set down breakfast... eh..not good. the sausage was gross, the pancakes tasted like the batter consisted of just flour and water- tasteless. Overall completely unappetizing! Went back for the breakfast sandwiches and muffins a few weeks later though...still good but not as good as the first time. The place is kind of dingy and the service is below average. Do not know that I would recommend it to anyone.\n",

            "Shane's is ok but the pulled pork sandwich is very bland, even with extra, extra barbecue sauce.  The ribs are pretty good but they are still not like real barbecue on the grill.  The macaroni and cheese was very watery...which can only mean either the sauce has too much water or they did not drain the noodles good, or at all.  All in all, I will probably go back but no time soon.\n",

Crowd is the college/just out of college crowd, and you are gauranteed to see somebody get into a fight.  Food Sucks too.  I throw a tantrum everytime somebody says we are going here.  If I am going to go somewhere sucky, it should at least suck in good ways, and this place does not.  I will give it 2 stars just cuz you know if you walk in here, you are going to see some funny poeple make asses of themselves.  Man am I in a bad mood today or something!? ;)\n",
            "Good gluten friendly options and accommodation of dietary restrictions. Cheap happy hour drinks. Food was nothing spectacular, salmon was over cooked.

Large tables available for groups.\n",

First impression walking in, it was bright, clean and everyone had a smile on their face.  I ordered the pear/arugula salad and an arancini ball and my friend got the prosciutto panini.  Sadly we were disappointed.\n",
            "\n",
            "So my salad, you cannot really screw that up, though there was WAY too much blue cheese on top.   The arancini ball, it was dry and the marinara/red sauce that came with it was very, very bland.  I had my concerns that the arancini balls might be dry only because at the counter they were in the glass warming container where the cooked pizzas were kept.  But I thought I would give them a try anyway because I love arancini balls.  Not only were they dry but they had no taste to them, could have used some salt and pepper for sure.  I thought the dipping sauce would help but it was really watery and just bland, bland, bland.\n",
            "\n",
            "My friend did not fair well with her panini either.  My friend loves prosciutto but the panini was really oily/greasy.  It could have been better if perhaps they had blotted the sandwich just a bit to get off some of that excess.  \n",

My boyfriend ordered the swordfish tacos and one was completely raw, when we told the waitress  she said she would let a manager know, that was the last we heard of it.  After she brought us the bill that included the full price of the tacos we asked again about the tacos and she said tha manager asked how much was eaten of the meal (which was 3 tacos) so because  he ate the 2 that were cooked I guess that was good enough and did not warrant a visit to the tab or a discount\n",

            "Veggie cigars were five star great, but veggie tagine was artichokes, peas, and carrots in sauce. The sauce was great, but the veggies were not substantive. This place I am sure is better for meat eaters.\n",

Needed sauce, which we ordered. Fresh tazaiki was really good. Falafel platter for the vegetarian: veggies were really good, falafels were ok. Lamb gyro: was just horrible, first I thought for the price it was rather skimpy. What was worse was the meat. There was so much gristle I was unable to chew.\n",

The salad was good enough that I actually ate the chunks of tomatoes  in it, and for those of you who know me you know that I hate chunks of tomato.  HATE THEM! On the downside, I ordered the meat medium, and the pieces ranged from well done to medium-rare, and I found them to be on the salty side.  Whatever, I was hungry, it was beef, down it goes.\n",

            "I feel I need to update this review.  Went back a second time, and ordered completely different items on the menu, and did not like anything.  It seemed as if the manager reads Yelp, because the things we complained about in an earlier review had been addressed - except to the absolute opposite in awfulness.  For example,  last time the waitress took my partner's plate away while he was still eating, and yet refused to refill our water glasses - even when she was standing next to our table holding the water pitcher.\n",
            "\n",
            "This time around, she was uncomfortably obsequious.  She literally watched us like a hawk, as we lifted each forkful of food to our mouths.  Each time either of us took a sip of water, she rushed over and would fill the glass just a smidgeon.  It felt as if she were a passive-aggressive trying to make a point to her manager - \"you want me to be more attentive, I will give you attentive!\"\n",

            "Herrell's is famous, but I am never overly-impressed. It is good ice cream, yes, but it is not \"OHMYGODTHISISTHEGREATESTICECREAMEVER\" good. Their toppings are rather decadent (as you would expect) and service good. Worth stopping in, but do not think that this is going to be the greatest ice cream experience of your life.\n",

But guys... you have been open quite some time now and the same things are on the menu.  Time to change it out.  I have started just going for wine and going elsewhere for dinner because I am tired of having the same thing.  Sorry, Love the place, but it is time for a change.\n",
            "The pizza is pretty standard- do not expect anything over the top.  This place has the kind of menu you would expect of a pizza place: pizza, specialty pizza, burritos, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, etc. Its also more of a pick up joint rather than an eat in restaurant (although you can...) They  also deliver.\n",

            "The place is small, and they have this fake fireplace in the corner. I suppose it makes it sort of \"home-y\"- if that is what you are looking for from a pizza joint. They also have these saloon doors to the kitchen that look pretty sweet. Good time to pretend like you are in a Western.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I came here around 5:30 pm on a Monday and were immediately seated- within the next 10-15 minutes a long line had formed, so definitely try to come early because it is a small space and fills up fast. It is cash only, which is somewhat inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. My boyfriend got the original ramen with extra noodles and felt like there still were not enough noodles compared to the amount of broth. Overall, he liked his though. I got the vegetarian ramen and found that the broth was pretty flavorless. However, I can appreciate the fact that they even serve a vegetarian ramen as most places do not offer this option. I have had vegetarian ramen at other places in the past and the broth was much more flavorful, so I know it is possible to make a good veggie ramen.\n",

I could make 20 of these for $9. The green papaya slaw with chilis, peanuts, limes is fresh, but nothing special. The garlicky spicy coal-black wings is one of the better appetizers. The wings are above average and the coal black sauce is quite delicious. \n",

            "From the vegetarian menu, avoid ordering the black pepper shanghai noodles with tofu, porta bellas, peanuts, cilantro, and lime. I do not like these one bit. I tried to eat as much as I could because I did not want to waste the $16 I spent on this dish. It is completely overpowering. There is too much black pepper and lemon. In fact, that is all I could taste.\n",

It is a roomy restaraunt. It does not looks so big from the side, but once i walked in, I was impressed! The seats were quite comfortable. Of course being brand new the dishes were perfect (meaning no chips). \n",

            "Anyways, the whole set up is painful to watch. It takes an entire afternoon for them to assemble these Sushi Burritos. Steal the playbook from Chipotle or Mucho -- just dump all that fillings together, no need to neatly spread them across, nobody gots time for that. It is all in the wrapping -- just wrap that up properly. \n",

            "Ate here last Thursday night. Good vibe in the room. Reasonably busy; they had some empty tables. My dining partner and I chose the Tasting Menu. First course set the bar high. It was creative and perfect. The kitchen did not hold back on the use of shrimp paste or fish sauce nor the chili. Yet it was handled in just the right amount. A laudable skill. Second course was a soup. Plump shrimp and the broth was good. \n",
            "Subsequent courses saw the chili levels and fish sauce base fall off. A little confusing on the palatte. Serving size was generous and third course on wards was serve family style. Meat dishes were cooked perfectly. Not overcooked as in other Thai restaurants. \n",
            "Desert presentation displayed a heartfelt effort. However it was forgettable. My friend described it as tasting out of a prepared can. I am sure there was sincere effort put in and they will continue to do so. \n",
            "Service once we were seated was good. We were sadly not greeted nor acknowledged for what felt like 10 minutes when we first entered. Even though 4 staff walked by us at the front door. There was also no sense of presence from any one staff in the room. It is decently run not mind-blowing. hence the 3 stars. \n",

So after seeing so many commercials and having a great love for seafood, I had dinner here on my last day of vacation. Sat down and was greeted by a very friendly server. They had the pick your own Seafood Trio for $15.99  on the menu which my date and I were down for. I ordered the garlic-grilled shrimp skewer, garlic shrimp scampi, and lobster mac & cheese. The unlimited and complimentary cheddar cheese biscuits they serve are to die for. I could eat those all day. When my entree came, I was disappointed though. My lobster mac & cheese had very chewy lobster, the garlic shrimp scampi was drenched in butter in a not so appealing way (seemed to be microwaved as well), and the garlic-grilled shrimp skewer had absolutely no flavor... Maybe it was just what I ordered that was bad? I should have ordered my first choice which was the wood-grilled lobster, shrimp and scallops entree dish but I was being frugal and ended up disappointed with what I ordered.

I will be brutally honest, for $12.99 i expected the BEST Chicken N' Waffles ever tasted but instead I was left wishing for a $6-8 Publix Chicken Tender meal.

It is peculiar they chose to use white meat chicken tenders vs dark meat.  The waffles were slightly above lukewarm and a bit bland I AM GOING TO.  I was hoping for some flavoring, vanilla of some sorts.  I went on opening day, opening hour, so the lukewarm waffles were a bit of a shocker.  \n",

Even if it was priced half I would much rather get myself 3 pieces of chicken tender, waffle mix (or cinnabonwaffles in waffle iron), and maple syrup at Publix  and still have money to spare.  Nothing bad to say about the sides since they were very tasty.  Chicken N' Waffles + grits + fried okra + cornbread + root beer came out to $24!!!!!!!@$@!$!#  Mind you I am a big fan of 4 Rivers too, mainly because there is not much competition for good BBQ but chicken places are a dime a dozen.  The atmosphere and the way it operates was efficient and unique.  I loved the ambiance/theme of the restaurant.

Coffee and sandwich were almost $9.\n",

The restaurant Seven lamps has a great atmosphere. Big wooden tables. It has an open rustic feel to it. However, the food did not impress me as much as I wanted it to. We ordered mussels, which tasted old & had a smell to them. The lobster bun was my favorite out of our entire meal, but it does not compare to the lobster roll at Beetle Cat.  & we finished the night off with the trout, which did not impress me either. Overall, the service was great & the atmosphere, but the food just did not leave an impression on me. I may give it another try in the future.\n",

It is not horrible by any means,just not out standing and has no creative dishes to speak of.\n",

I ordered the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream; its a 14 oz sirloin seasoned with black peppercorn for a spicy flavor. I asked for it to be prepared medium well, and the first cut was like I butchered and slaughtered it myself, bloody!!! I sent it back, it returned still too red in the center for my liking. So, before returning it again, I asked to make it well done to be on the safe side. That request was ignored, and it was brought back for the third time at the best attempt for medium well. I am sure it lost some of its tenderness because of the back and forth attempts to cook it properly. The best thing about this steak was the seasoning and sauce drizzled over it. My boyfriend got the All-Natural Herb Roasted Chicken, which he neither raved or complained about. \n",

Sort of touristy but the food was wonderful, the service attentive, and the prices were not outrageous considering what we ordered.  We stuck to the fixed price assortment - the $30 per person one.

But it seems like the kitchen staff could use some hairnets.\n",

Lamar on Braker. I was greeted quickly and courteously and my order was taken promptly. I went with the green onion pie and a bowl of pork feet noodle soup.  The green onion pie was nicely done and not nearly as greasy as the one at Coco's and was served with a little bowl of spicy roasted red pepper in oil - to which I promptly added soy sauce. \n",
            "\n",
            "The noodle soup came piping hot with fresh handmade noodles (quite good) and some bok choy. The soup was light but bordered on slightly bland. I did dump in some cilantro, sliced red onions and green onions that came on a dish. That helped the flavor a bit. However, I think the intent was for the slow-roasted pork shank (served on a separate plate) to provide the flavor, which it did nicely with hints if anise and other spices. Though quite tasty, I wished that there was more meat to complement the tendons and skin. \n",

We came here for breakfast a few weeks ago, and I realized that this small-town breakfast spot is just like your usual townie breakfast nooks.  The staff was friendly and very efficient.  I really enjoyed my banana French toast, and my boyfriend enjoyed his eggs benedict with corned beef hash.  Yes, they pack you in like sardines, but I still ate comfortably and had a great meal.

They do not even try to accommodate you if you do not have reservations. They tell you it is 35-45min but they do not ever follow up with you. We had to go check on our wait and they told us another 45min!! Ridiculous!! Eventually we sat down. The food was good. We had chicken and red velvet waffles and chicken sandwich with fried okra. Biggest problem for us they charge you $5 for each person for entertainment. This was not told to us AT ALL!! Not to mention the band was not even playing while we were there because they were on break!! That needs to be addressed when customers sit down at the table. I do not appreciate paying for entertainment that I did not get. It is a small spot with a lot going on but decent nonetheless.\n",
            "Taco Platter (calamari, crispy chicken and beef). All were good.  None I would say were great. Dumplings not awesome. Felt like the inside was wet/slimy. Miso soup was average.  The calamari was the best, then the beef, then chicken. How do you not have Kimchi when it is all over the menu!!??  That was really disappointing. There are enough places around to try other options.\n",

While it is true, my friends and I can be a rowdy bunch, we were on our best behavior that night.  We were a party of 8, and the waiter was terrible.  He poured through bottles of wine far too quickly - he poured through a bottle without even getting to half of the party.  One of my friends, who works in the wine industry, was peeved to the max - the waiter was pouring to get us through as many bottles as possible.  We actually told the waiter to chill out for a bit (he kept pushing us to order more bottles of wine).  The service from the waiter was terrible but the somelier was the saving grace.  The somelier was phenomenal, and the wine list is extensive.\n",

I was pleasantly surprised by the spicy wontons which came out covered in a thicker sauce that tasted a bit like extra spicy peanut butter. The stir fried rice cake w/ pork was nicely cooked and deeply flavored. Unfortunately,  the orange chicken we ordered was a bit of a disappointment - the chicken was rather dry and the dish way too salty. \n",

It was good - very sweet. One of the people who were with me got the Eggs Benedict and said it was good and apparently the Denver Omelet was really good. The service was pretty good although they did not take our reservation and instead put us in line when we called which got us seat 15 minutes earlier.\n",
            "My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I am a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty did not have much flavor and there was not much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I am all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \n",

The vegetable delight could have been bigger and I feel like there should have been a larger assortment of items. It only consisted of three types of mushrooms, one type of tofu, broccoli, a piece of corn, carrots, and three types of greens. During the end of our meal, our waiter brought over a cart of vegetables (which I did not know would happen) and asked if we had wanted more. I guess this must be the unlimited vegetables that everyone keeps talking about. I just wish that this had been brought to our attention sooner.\n",

The delivery was fast and our driver was very friendly and courteous. It was pretty cheap, too, thanks to a coupon I found on the cover of the Savvy Shopper. We did not have traditional Greek toppings, so that might have been part of the reason I was underwhelmed. Not the worst pizza I have ever had but not the best, either.\n",

I was looking forward the main course based on the appetizers.   However, I was really dissappointed in the Chicken Francese.  The sauce was terribly bland, no lemon, no spices.  I ate half, but for their signature dish it did not cut it by a long shot.  My wife got he chicken Parmesan and it was pretty much standard stuff.  Nothing like \"wow, this is great.\"  It is hard to find good Italian in this city, coming from upstate NY.  But bottom line is this is average Italian, maybe slightly above.\n",

Somehow the 12 of us made 10 or so appetizers + 170 pieces of sushi (mix with rolls)  disappear and even with my beer it only cost me $26 including tip.\n",

Customer service is non existent do not expect guidance, a thank you or so much as anyone giving a rip you are a patron. The mimosas taste like sugary Minute Maid orange juice.  My hope was coffee, a small pastry and a mimosa. No pastries. I ordered the charcuterie board and salmon. The salmon was good however capers must be a luxury because my board had a total of six. The salami and what I assumed was prosciutto looked as if they had sat out all night before. Did not eat them it was so unappetizing. I will come back strictly for the location and perhaps a glass of wine with no expectations.\n",

The pork taco had cheddar cheese on it which was odd.  I had what was supposed to be a shredded beef taco and instead it was a ground beef taco with a chicken burrito which was nothing out of the ordinary.  They came with the standard rice and refried beans.  \n",

The Fish was not fishy tasting at all & was very mild & great in size. ALso service was slow to start.\n",

We walked into two of them and they smelled funny and had a real weird vibe.  Desta on the other hand was up beat, lively and smelled good.  Other than seeing people eat with their hands you never would guess you were in an Ethiopian place.  Let Us be honest Ethiopian food does not conjure up thoughts of heavenly good eats nor makes your mouth salivated upon mentioning its cuisine like let us say Grandma's meatballs.  However, this place was great.  Everything was freshly made, served with a smile and tasted great.  I would definitely go back and experiment on the menu a little more.  We all had the house specialty tibs and all was were very pleased.\n",

I knew my Our House Days were over when I was trying to get a drink at the bar one crowded Saturday night and I smelled something really funky, like vomit - well guess what, it was not \"like\" vomit, IT WAS VOMIT! All over the floor right in front of my feet and the poor drunk (and probably underage kid) still had his head down on the bar hurling all over the place. What a great last memory to have huh? Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, vomit amd all....\n",

I was brought a complimentary pot of tea as I looked over their extensive menu.  Beef Tomato Chow Mein with Panfried Noodles has always been a favorite of mine so that is what I ordered.  I was impressed with the size of the portion I got. . .HUGE.  However, I wish it was more \"tomatoey\" tasting because that is the whole point of ordering something with tomato in it.  Also, the panfried noodles were a bit soft. . .they should have been slightly crispy.  The good thing I noticed was the quality of the beef, which was tender, and not tough and chewy.  Service was friendly and fast.  My dinner was OK. . .though not anything special. . .but I will be back to try other items on their menu.\n",

            "I have been to Myers and Chang a couple times earlier this year and was excited to go back with family. The flavors of the food and the options made this place one of my favorites in Boston. However, when I visited this restaurant earlier this month, the menu shrunk, our server kept ignoring us throughout the night, and the food had so much sodium! There were not that many options in terms of food this time around and most of the meals now are just noodles and rice Asian fusion dishes. Out of the three times I have come, I always get the Wok-Charred Udon Noodles but this time it was so salty I had to keep drinking water for the rest of the meal and for the rest of the night. Even getting a side of rice did not help so much. \n",

Maybe to try one of the Molcajete, which looked impressive and is not a standard at other restaurants. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but I had the mole, which was a good size serving of pork chunks with traditional brown mole sauce. Unfortunately, the mole was like the stuff you can buy at the grocery store, not an authentic abuela recipe. Bummer. The beans and rice were basic, much like what you would get at a less expensive Tex-Mex restaurant. My friend, who is a frequent traveler to Mexico, ordered the Chile Colorado and pronounced it \"nothing great\". The free chips and two red salsas were good - one bright flavors, the other smokier and not as spicy. Our waiter, though friendly and fairly attentive, must have been new because he was pretty clueless about the menu, and had to go ask someone to answer our menu-related questions. The cucumber margarita was a fun twist on an old favorite, and it packed a punch. Nice atmosphere and easy parking, so that is a plus. It sounds like the patio is nice, so that might lure me back for drinks and chips but I would probably skip the food.\n",
            "I have usually had a good experience here , and maybe it was because it was late but that is no excuse for my \"salad\" to be just lettuce and they put the dirty receipt IN my food. Right in the hummus.\n",
            "Unfortunately this place disappointed when we went there for dinner.  My date ordered the very American General Tso's chicken and said it had really poor quality meat in there.  The chajang mien and dumplings were still pretty yummy, but service was not really all that warm.  The koi pond is cool, but it makes for kind of a weird smell inside the restaurant.  I will probably still come here for pick-up, but we will probably go to Fortune Cookie from now on to get our Chinese food fix.\n",
            "I went here for a conference and it was fine by me. The employees were pretty good but I hate the extra fee to use the fitness center. I ran around the pretty busy area from 9-10 pm with path chosen with help from the staff instead.  I could not believe how many people were out that late on a weeknight. Expect to pay $15-$20 for parking per day for parking unless you are handicap. It is nice that it is right along the $1.50 buses that take you to major attractions. The pool also looks amazing but I am not sure if there is an extra fee to use it... Food is pretty good but pricey.\n",

Also, there was some lady at the table across from us that kept giving me the stink eye for some reason during our entire meal,LOL. Not sure what that was all about.

I would say the Out of Control poutine (which was Carolina bbq, when we visited) was the best thing on the table, though the bbq sauce (and I am a big fan of Carolina bbq) drowned out the frites and poutine. The risotto was nice but not extraordinary (which is what I would hope for with a veggie risotto priced at $20). Others enjoyed their burger and steak, but thought they were not as interesting as they would expected.\n",

Which is rather ironic, seeing as how the whole place seems to try to scream \"We are different!\" From the hanging bats in the entryway (yes, we get the joke), to the 'funny' names of food items, we were not particularly wowed. Add the dark lighting situation (is it supposed to be thematic?), the volume, and the menu, I do not think we will be back anytime soon.\n",

Overall, this place is packed, good services but the food is not for my taste. It is good experience to try something new while visiting Vancouver.\n",
            "The seating in this restaurant is very close together and I did not get that hip urban sense of coolness...more like closeness. My son and I tried the Chicken and Vietnamese sandwiches which were very good. The pork buns were, as others had mentioned, were sort of a melange of flavors without being very satisfying. I agree the portions are small for the price. For what they charge and the discomfort of being so close together coupled with the good but not outstanding food at lunch...I think next time I would go elsewhere.\n",

Screw healthy. Next time I am getting chowder & bluefish pate. I want to know that I just ate something when I am throwing down more than$20 on food.\n",
            "This place is more cozy than the food is good, but it is an interesting change of pace and has a nice atmosphere. I will probably be back here on a nice day to hang out under their ivy-covered outdoor-seating terrace and get some work done.\n",
            "She raved about the marinara. I found it good. Not sweet. Not extraordinary. I prefer mine a bit more Diablo. The meatballs were a good size. Not baseballs, not marbles. Plenty of meat, without seeing or tasting a lot of filler. This was on the open face smothered dish. \n",
            "Pizza was great. Thin and crispy, just the way we like it. It was not brittle like a cracker. Just thick enough to give a slight chew. Cheese had great stretchability. No snap back, like fake rubbery imitation cheese. The pepperoni had great seasoning. \n",

One crunch tuna roll was neither crunchy nor tasty, we sent it away. The only item that was really good was the scallop sushi. Brussels sprouts were just a pile in a bowl, like I make at home.

We ordered some grilled wings to start and a small cesar salad, I was not too crazy about the wings but my boo liked them. He ordered another cesar salad and I ordered the bbq chicken salad that the waiter recommended, he said it was good and delicious because of the avocados. My salad came, I tossed the salad and see no avocados. I told the waiter that it had no avocado and he said \"ok I will bring you some more\" more?! It did not have any lol. He brought a tiny little cup with squeezed avocados in it.  Mistake #2. Then my boyfriends salad never came, we had to remind the waiter. Mistake #3 .

            "I wanted to really love this cute little pizzeria. For the most part I did. We had a groupon for 25.00 worth of food or so I thought we did. Tyler the young man working who was very very sweet explained that it was only good for anything made with dough. Such as pizza, or calzone. So salads, or wraps would not count. He explained that it was an error on groupons part but we could not order the salads or wraps with the groupon. Oh well. I ordered a calzone, he ordered a calzone, my daughter ordered a large Cesar salad and one slice of pizza. The hubby really wanted a veggie wrap but went with the calzone so we could use the groupon. I ordered an ice tea and they both had water. They had no lemon for my tea. It was not enough to use the 25.00 so Tyler suggested the garlic knots. We took a sit and waited for our food. The restaurant is open, airy  with TV's and had that Italian restaurant feel. Including the painted scenery on the wall. We were there on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and we were the only ones in the place for a while. They have a great selection of beer if you are looking for one. About 10 minutes after sitting there Tyler came over and brought the garlic knots. They were nice,hot and had a great garlic buttery glazed on them. They were served with a hot marinara sauce. I paid close attention to the sauce being hot because several reviewers had mentioned that they served it cold. They have improved this which was a nice touch. He mentioned he would be right back with my daughters salad and he was. At this time he also mentioned that the slice of pizza would take a little while longer since it is fresh made a they were making a new pie. That was not a problem since we were waiting on our calzones. After 10 minutes more, Tyler came back and mentioned that they would not be able to make the slice after all because they only had one oven on and they had gotten a few delivery orders in and were using the oven to make those orders.(Are you kidding me). He offered us something else and was willing to make us the original veggie wrap my hubby had wanted from the start. We were fine with this even though the slice was my daughters because her salad was HUGE. We finally got our calzones and they were so big they did not fit on the tray he brought them on. And they were served with hot marinara sauce on the side. He got the veggie and I got the meat one. They both were very hot and yummy. We both ended up taking half home. As mentioned they were huge but I feel they could have had more filling in them it was a lot of dough. Very doughy. I was not even sure there was cheese in it. The bathrooms were well kept and clean. Simply decorated in red and white. Tyler was very nice and apologized about everything and hoped we would come back. I am sure we will since my daughter goes to UCF and next term is getting an apartment literally almost next door to the place. It is worth it if you are in the area. Not sure yet if I would go out of my way to go there. Have to get to try the pizza first to know that.\n",

As mentioned before, we popped in for a quick bite before our show so obviously did not have a reservation; the very friendly manager told us that it would be about a 30 minute wait. We sat and waited for about 10 minutes until I noticed that people were eating at the bar and asked if we could just sit there. No probs; we sat down and were served with chips and water immediately. We ordered a couple of cocktails (mistake, stick with the margs - this is a mexican food place, afterall), the carnita quesadillas (husband enjoyed, I did not try them), and I got the southwest salad with chicken. Salad was very good (chipotle lime dressing was tasty and smokey) and very fresh. Both of the bartenders were really friendly. All in all, good experience... likely would not drive the 15 minutes from our house here, but if we are out and about, we will keep it in mind!\n",

They are not rude or anything, though that one guy at the door can learn to say hello and smile when you walk in the door, but the service is so laissez-faire.

We had wanted to sit outside to enjoy our last remaining hours of warmth before returning to frigid temps. The \"hostess\" got huffy at our request and said their staff was overwhelmed and she could not accommodate us so try the bar. Upon inspection of the property there were maybe 4 tables outside and 6 inside that had guests. Really? We sat at the bar, the bartender was more than happy to assist us. Chose the calamarie and rice mozzarella balls which were delicious. I had the sausage pizza which was rather burnt on the bottom and only was able to eat the center. My sister had the sundried tomato pizza which she said tasted like a salt lick. We did not bother with dessert (especially with Ghiradelli being around the corner). I did speak to the manager who wanted to comp us dessert which was not necessary but kind of him to offer. Just teach your servers to react in more appropriate and a professional manner.

They often have beer specials, and then there is the \"free-beer-at-5.00-on-Friday\" thing that Donnelly does, but it always seems a little flat, and that it does not taste quite right. On weekends the place turns to a full-on club type atmosphere, complete with lineups, cover charge, bouncers, and the whole deal. It is not my thing anymore, but the crowd seems pretty friendly and they play decent music, so it could be a lot worse. Oh yeah, and the waitresses are generally pretty cute (though not always that great at their jobs).\n",

I am always amused by people watching here.  It usually gets packed by 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, and parking is always ridiculously hard to find after 10 pm.\n",

Menu was more like a lunch menu--not only were the choices pretty dull, the menu itself was cheap and unattractive.  We thought we were going out for a nice dinner, but most of us ended up with a hamburger since there was nothing particularly \"nice\" to eat.  The burgers were fine, but nothing special.  The fries were good!  Service was so slow and our server so disinterested that we did not even ask to see the dessert menu.  Will not go back.\n",

I could tell this place had a big whiskey selection, and it looked like a lot of wine too, but I am a beer drinker. The beer list was decent, definitely not bad, but nothing special. Prices were good all around. This place is super convenient to where I live, so I will probably be back, but if it was not so convenient I probably would not go out of my way.\n",

Over cooked octopus, undercooked cappellacci, under warmed chocolate cake, port wine with a glass full of sediment. Small tweaks would make all the difference. Service was excellent, however.\n",
            "I am going 3 as this is a tossup with our party of two couples.  Our experience arriving 2 was 1 star and the food was quite good.  I was told the steaks the others had were nearly the best they have eaten ever while my prime rib was lukewarm...potato lukewarm...but both very tasty.  I recommend starting with a reservation or you will not get in likely on a busy night for a long time.  Better yet start at happy hour (one of the best happy hours in town) and walk a drink to your table so you can be there, relax and then be seated.  The steaks did indeed look fantastic.  Sides good, salad (house) very good.  We split a super good piece of red velvet and the wine list is very nice.  Price was less than a Ruths Chris by a little but the service and food was better it seemed to my friends.  I would put the food on par.  While corrected somewhat by the manager, our check in experience was 1 star.  We were told a 15-20 minute wait and after about 40 minutes (we were hanging at the bar so no rush) I was told they tried contacting me (explain how I did not get your text?) and suddenly there is a table.  They knew we were at the bar, a handful of steps away from their stand.  At the 50 minute mark we were given a booth despite having asked for a table.  No table and 20 more minutes if we want one.  Thankfully Matt the manager intervened and magically had a table.  The hostesses (3 of them??) are amateurish and not at all what you would want quarterbacking the guests in my opinion.  They are nice I suppose but I see other problems with reservations and them frankly in other comments...this needs fixing...not a good first impression.\n",

We arrived right at the lunch rush, the wait was not that long, but the table seating name taking process needs to be changed. Your supposed to give your name to a girl behind the counter to be put on a waiting list for tables. She is so busy with take out orders and such that you cannot get anywhere near her if she is even there. Their claim is that they do not cook your chicken until you order it. I ordered a 3 piece dark plate which consists of 1 leg and 2 thighs, and 2 sides. My wife and daughter both ordered chicken strips. My chicken was slightly overdone, which I could live with, but what I did not like was that it was not hot. It was a safe temperature, but not fresh from the fryer. It did not even steam when I took a bite. It was also slightly dried out. The breading although good is not significant enough to protect the chicken from the outer layer getting dried out.\n",

It says it has orange / horchata flavors but I only tasted a slight citrus tang, which did not really differentiate it that much for me. The lemon poppyseed cake donut reminded me of those lemon loaves from Starbucks, the donut itself felt like a plain one just covered in special frosting that was lemon / poppyseed flavored. \n",

I received a full tray salad (even questioned the size while it was being made) with falafel but no hummus and had to ask for the feta.  They tried to charge me $11; I inquired about the price and the gentleman only charged me the $8.00.  Only after paying did I realize I had no hummus.  I will say the kebobs looked good and I will give them another try.\n",

Once we finally made it to our table and ordered, our food took about another 45 minutes. The food was delicious and they had tons of very unique selections on the menu. The waitstaff was friendly and very attentive. She did forget our coffee, but we did not want to wait any longer. The atmosphere is a mix between casual and dressy. I would definitely be interested in trying some of their lunch menu items because those also looked very delicious. Will probably give this place another shot only because their food was so good.\n",

Service is really lacking. It is disjointed and a bit sloppy. The person who poured my water and brought my bread did not say a word or look at me. As a patron you have to be proactive, and follow up regarding the status of your food. I sat for 15 minutes before my server came over. After my appetizer I waited another 20 before he came back with my entree which just arrived as I write this. My haddock is cooked well but there zero seasoning and THREE gnocchi. Again the plate was just kind of dropped in front of me and he walked away. He did not ask if I wanted another glass of wine ( I did but now I will not). Food is borin.

            "We decided to nosh a little, since we needed to drive home at some point - my friend opted for the mussels off the appetizer menu and I got the Bruschetta.  SO YUMMY!\n",
            " I can not speak for the mussels because she was bogarting them but the bruschetta was a meal unto itself -- grilled chicken, goat cheese, roma tomato, onions all atop grilled focaccia (see my picture).  I think for an appetizer it could have been just as good without the chicken, but I appreciated the twist.\n",
            "A side note - the bread is homemade and you can tell and it comes with a chickpea concoction (they were keen to point out that it was not hummus). Double yum ... no that is triple yum because I forgot the gimlet (perish the thought :)\n",

We immediately got a table but had to wait for drinks, then for refills then for food - forever between each. The server was nice enough, super methodical and got everything right but slower than Christmas. I think that they might have been understaffed because I only saw a couple of servers, a busser, a bartender and a hostess while we were there and they were busier than that ... \n",

I ordered the veggie burger which by the way was really yummy. My son had ordered it but it was not for him. I took it home. And expecting it just to be mediocre, it was amazing! I am craving it right now as I speak. I wish I was swimming in it. It is that good. Now, I do not think that it suits everyone. But it really made my night as a late night snack and I am hooked.\n",
            "Meat eating crowd, but a few VEGETAERIAN options, more than just then normal appetizers. Me and my wife (a vegetarian)\\ came here on a Saturday night around 730. Not too busy. Good Music. Friendly Staff. We started off with potato skins. You get 4 rather large helpings of them. Very good! Rather crispy and cheesy. My wife got a portobello mushroom burger on focaccia bread. Very tasty. The bread was wonderful. Feta cheese on the sandwich which was a happy suprise, paired very well with the mushroom. I, myself, got a french dip. Tender flavorful roast beef and tangy swiss. Au Jus was spiced very good and full of flavor. The french bread was EXCELLENT. $41 bill for 2 people and 4 drinks. Would definitely love to come back as there were a few things on the menu that sounded very good as well.\n",

Local oysters from MA and RI: excellent (although admittedly all that SS did was shuck them).  Wood Grilled Lobster: Very good (probably more because at the end of the day I like my lobsters in the traditional way, boiled in sea water)  Bluefish special: very good.  Fish and chips: very good.  Overall a very nice meal although our server was admittedly new so service was slow.  I will not hold that against her.  It has been a good standby for me over the years.\n",

It has a sesame seed covered bun and it comes with a 100% grass fed beef burger where you choose the sides. I like my burgers fairly plain so I added lettuce, onion, tomato layered with Wisconsin CHEDDAR! YES!!! The burger itself is not greasy by any means, but they season it with such care that one bite into it results in an explosion of flavor in the mouth. I wish I had a party like that in my mouth everyday.\n",

            "For the 2 sides, we went with some mashed potatoes and 4-cheese macaroni. The sides were smaller than anticipated (about the size of my fist - which is not much). Covered in delicious gravy, the mashed potatoes tasted like mother's. As for the 4-cheese macaroni? Eh. The crumble on top was epic, but the mac (sadly) lacked flavor! I had to add some salt, which is weird for me.\n",

            "Just ate here for the first time.  I walked in and looked at the menu which had various pizzas as well as some appetizers, main dishes and sandwiches.  I was really in the mood for some pizza but I did not want to order an entire pizza.  I noticed that they had a premade crust with some sauce on it in the display case and asked about.  I am really glad I did because while they do not show it on the menu they actually do pizza by the slice and will put whatever toppings you want on the ready to go crust.\n",
            "\n",
            "I decided to try 2 slices of the Crudo e Funghi pizza.  The pizza was one of the better ones I have tried north of Long Island.  The wood fired oven gave it a nice character yet it has not charred like some tend to be.  It was slightly pricey for 2 slices of pizza at $7.49 but given the high end fresh ingredients they were using it seemed fairly reasonable.  This is definitely going on my list of worthy lunch spots in Beverly and will be my go to place if I want a good slice of pizza.\n",
            "If you like dive bars, this is a good one to start at.  Nothing on the walls, poor lighting, and a sketchy bathroom is all part of the charm of this nice little bar.\n",

            "Overall they make delicious sandwiches, so I would definitely recommend visiting this place.\n",
            "Not my first time here but it is definitely been awhile. I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the \"best Pho in Austin.\" I am not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I do not remember.\n",
            "The drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I do not know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I have only been here like 3 times). \n",
            "I guess I never noticed before because I have never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. \n",
            "The flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. \n",
            "I actually did not opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they did not put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it is like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. \n",
            "If I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.\n",
            "Have been wanting to go to The Painted Pin for the past year. Finally went last night and had a fantastic time. Mature crowd and for the grown and sexy. Nice to be in a place where we all could enjoy ourselves with no worries about mayhem. No children after five so grown ups can relax freely. Live music was a nice touch. Food is not bad,  better than your standard bowling fare. The seating area is small when the max occupancy for the lane is six. Really only sits 3 people comfortably. Our server,  Sabrina, was absolutely great. Worked hard. I hope you got good tips all night,  Sabrina. Good service is a rarity these days.  Would go again.\n",
            "Good beer and good food. I had the chicken quesadila wraps and they were pretty good. I also ordered a side order of Onion Rings for the table and they were da bomb, I highly suggest you get them. The beer was good and I would go back next time I am in the area.\n",
            "After 2 nights of chain restaurants, I needed an original.  Wish I would have gone here on day 1.  Got the Patacon with shredded beef.  It was great, highly recommend.  Kids (teenagers, one of which is pretty picky) ordered the Cuban and the chicken empanada.  Everyone was happy.  We walked over from our hotel and took dinner back; after walking in, I wish we would have stayed, it looked like charming place.\n",
            "Went here last year and loved it. Had the tasting menu and everything was so tasty and fresh. I felt like i was in Europe as had such a good feel. Great price for the food. Great date place.\n",

            "I will be back.\n",
            "MMmm!!! A really great place to eat a fish-shaped sandwich! I told the pretty lady \"surprise me with cheddar and bacon\" and she got my order right! The best thing is that since these sandwiches are fish-shaped you can have a fun time imagining them swimming around inside your stomach doing jumps and having fun. I loved this place so much that I rented a movie called \"GO FISH\" which I will review later. Thanks again guys, there is nothing fishy about this place except the food!\n",
            "I have tried a ton of thai places and this one is one of the best. The green curry with chicken and vegetable tempura were fantastic. I know there is some weak reviews for this place and I am not sure what the deal is, I would go back. The food was not too spicy, lots of great flavor and really quick delivery at a reasonable price. Yum Yum.\n",
            "I went last week and was very satisfied with the take-out.  The toasted ravioli were big warm and toasty.  We had a greek salad and a chicken parm sub.  Everything was great!  they are closed on Sundays and close at 8pm otherwise.  I think they deliver, but I walked over.  I will be back soon.\n",
            "If you are looking for a place to get some coffee and sit for a long time, this may or may not be the place for you. There is limited amount of seating inside the shop, but I love the outdoor seating in the summer. They have built-in heat lamps above the tables with a timer that you can control. The coffee itself is not anything to write home about, but you cannot go wrong with a latte. If you are sitting outside, you have a great view of the water behind the building which is just gorgeous at sunset. The biggest drawback that this place has is that it is wifi signal strength is the worst. It constantly drops when you are trying to log on to webpages, which is not the most ideal if you are taking an online quiz for a class.\n",
            "I really like this place, and I do not even like BECAUSE wines that much! I have ventured out to the dark and scary side (eastside) twice now to go to Vancouver Urban Winery and it does not disappoint. \n",
            "\n",
            "The place itself is really cool - lots of barrels, vats and a really high ceiling with a gorgeous, huge front door. The service has always been really great. Our bartender this time was so excited about wines, really engaging and made good recommendations when we did not know what to try. \n",
            "\n",
            "This second time, we came for dinner and sat at the bar. We each got a tasting flight and ordered a bunch of shared plates from the new Belgard Kitchen set up they have going on. Everything was really good, properly priced and came out pretty quickly. I really like spending an evening with friends here, and cannot wait to try out Belgard Kitchen for brunch!\n",
            "Wine tastings have a lot of sweet white and reds.  I wish they had more dry options but overall this place is awesome for drinks, apps, and full courses.  I have not had dessert just yet but that just gives me another excuse to go back :).\n",

            "They were having $5 cheese steaks which were pretty tasty. I wish they had added more cheese onto the sandwich, you had to look hard to know it was there because at first I thought they had left it out completely.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also tried the buffalo chicken sandwich and that one was the real winner for me. Fried white meat chicken, with the blue cheese dressing was absolutely delicious.\n",

            "\n",
            "The only thing I will say is that it is loud in there so if you are not in the mood to hear sports blaring on the TV, nor the fans cheering and commenting on it; I would grab the order to go.\n",

            "I always seek out Ethiopian after having lived in DC where I got to enjoy Ethiopian food on the reg. I traditionally go for mixed platters or lamb tibs and since the tibs were not on the menu I went for both a vegetarian and meat combo platter and sat at the traditional seating area as opposed to tables. I liked this experience and first time actually enjoying Ethiopian food in this manner. Food was pretty good but truly thought the vegetarian options were a lot stronger than the meat options. Overall it is a cute spot that is reasonably priced in the Cambridge area.\n",

Started with the Campo salad, then had family style appetizers of burrata, antipasta platter, and margherita pizza. The pizza was very light on cheese but well cooked and flavorful. For my first course I had Linguine ai Crostacei which was great, packed with lobster and crab meat. For my second course I had a fish wrapped in crispy potatoes. Delicious! The dessert was the only nonmemorable course. \n",

Still good, but this time I noticed there was a lot more shrimp and less lobster and crab meat. Also, I was there on a Tuesday evening, it was not very crowded, and yet the service was painfully slow. Took us hours to get out. Good thing we were not in a hurry.\n",
            "We first ate at Earl's Ontario and really enjoyed the experience. Great vibe and awesome food. We then discovered they would opened an Orlando location and decided to check it out. Apples to oranges on the vibe but the food and service was great! The warm potato salad is a must as well as the ribs! My husband got the sushi and steak and could not finish it all. Desserts are tasty. Worth a visit and great location at the Mall at Millenia with the only downer being you have to exit the mall interior to reach the restaurant entrance.\n",

The egg tasted as perfect as it looked; it made the ramen a solid 4 stars.\n",

I ordered the pork tacos as my main dish and I am so glad I did because they were amazing.

To contextualize at the risk of sounding pretentious, this is Italian food as served in Italy, rather than \"American Italian\" food, which is really a spin on nineteenth century regional (southern) Italian food with ingredient substitutions based on what was available to impoverished immigrants on the Lower East Side. Emphasis here seems to be on selecting superb quality fresh ingredients and putting them together in interesting and mildly experimental ways. I have never eaten better spinach than that which formed the base of my spinach salad, neither eaten a more comforting dish of gnocchi anywhere west of Sorrento. Just what the doctor ordered on a 20 degree Portland evening. I tend to benchmark Italian restaurants by the quality of the gnocchi; here served with pesto and crisp pancetta; just perfect.\n",

They have a little bit of everything, including soups, salad, vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, desserts, and chai tea. I love the aatish khumb, which is a mix of vegetables (mushrooms, onions, tomatoes) with a spice mix (their website says it is pickled spices). It is something I have never had at other Indian restaurants and it is been my favorite choice both times I have come. You also cannot go wrong with the saag paneer or the chicken tikka masala either. Both of those are pretty standard for Indian restaurants, but I really enjoyed the flavor here. One of the best things with the lunch buffet is that they bring you baskets of naan to go with your meal as well. I pretty much ate my weight in naan, which is not the worst thing. The service both times has been good and the place is very clean. Also, pro-tip: right now, if you check in on the Yelp app, they have a 15% off coupon. I work right around the corner for Cumin now, so I have a feeling this will become a regular lunch time spot.\n",

OK, so I had to move away to discover this, but better late than never. Growing up, I never really liked Santarpio's because of their \"slide-y\" cheese. But I understand it all now.

They make it seem like a chore to hand you menus. (Yes, you do not really need one, but I like something to look at.) They slap your pizza down on the table. They take forever to bring you the bill. But, it is all about the pizza... and the sausages. Everything else is meaningless.\n",

We were visiting family in town and had never been to Crepevine before, so they explained the process and made recommendations based on our food preferences. Everything was fantastic. My brother had never had crepes before and now he is a fan! I love that they make the crepes in front of you and because we were taking it to-go, they had us wait a bit for it to cool before boxing it up so it would not get soggy. They were perfectly crisp and delicious when we got back to the house. We would definitely visit again on our next trip to Altamonte!\n",

Although I give it 4 stars because b&g is a fantastic place any other time, the festival has a lot of room for improvement. Some bad points, expensive. Tickets are sold for 45 dollars before (but they sell out QUICKLY) and 75 if you want that VIP tickets (I opted for the 75 because I am a baller and because i do not like waiting in lines... which I was worried I have to do if I was to get them first come first serve...) Anywho, they give you 2 drink tickets (but drink tickets are only 5 dollars... so buy a bunch and you are golden) and the VIP kids get to go to stir (the little restaurant across the street) to get an Oyster Profile Lesson with the one and only Rowan Jacobson (who is a cutie I must add!) Started at 12 went on til 8, which seems like a long time but for an avid oyster lover, it is totally worth it. Walking around was really annoying though... there were stations of different oysters throughout the restaurant (inside and out) and during crowded times there would be a wait to get 3 or so oysters. But they were extremely fresh from all over the place (duxbury, kumamotos, wellfleets, fanny bays, oysters from nova scotia, sorry i started to forget where they were from as my drink tickets decreased) I ate probably around 50 to 80 oysters (along with the random samplings of lobster rolls, lobster bisque, clams, fried oysters, liquid oysters, etc...)and do not feel pretentious about it at all. it was also a very educational experience because oysters really are like a fine wine or cheese; they are very different and you never realize how different they are until you taste many different kinds side by side. Sorry this review is so long! Go b&g! Woo Oysterfest! Have it again!\n",
            "I have found that T's is a hit or miss bar. Right in the middle of Boston University's West Campus, some nights the crowd is great, other nights it is pretty terrible. The dance floor is tiny and there isn' a whole lot of space near the bar either. But the windows out front are nice for people watching and the kitchen has some pretty good food. Plus the projection TV is massive. Everyone who works here is involved with BU varsity sports, so be careful not to bad mouth the Terriers.\n",

Even the white meat  - usually the dryer parts of the bird - had no trouble keeping flavor . . . even after a night in the firdge. I did not try any sides becuase I prefer the mac and cheese and biscuits from Star Provision. I will certainly be back for the chicken though!\n",

I have never had a problem with the service (in fact, I have always noticed how fast they are), the wine list is extensive, and the food is good and reasonably priced.  I have brought some major foodies here (one who lives in Europe) and they have all loved it.  Personally, I usually get the Bolognese, which - when I have gotten it - is a thick and hearty red sauce with different ground meats, so I cannot speak for most of the rest of the menu (their antipasti are also very good, though).  The prices are very good for the quality of food they serve ($9 for the Tortellini Bolognese).  The late-night food is ok, but typical late night bites: pizza, calzones, the like.  \n",

When it is busy, they move quickly, and I appreciate that.\n",

The ones in Belgium are sold on the street without toppings, in a napkin and you just munch on them as you walk. I am pretty glad the Liege waffles here are less authentic that way.

That is $5 worth of premium toppings for a $6.50 burger!  I also wanted fries and decided to order a side of mac 'n cheese to share with my co-workers.  Yup, that is me going crazy!  =)\n",

I guess it would be crazy if it was not because it was $11.50 without fries!  At first, I thought my burger was cooked more medium-well than medium, but after a couple bites, I saw that the inside was a nice pink.  It was juicy and yummy.  I loved how fresh the arugula was, and the local bacon was thicker than regular bacon and flavorful.  It was a delicious burger, but it was not the best I have ever had (Bocado!).\n",

A side of horseradish and a requested side of sriracha = OM NOM NOM. The spouse ordered the short rib dinner, which came with a lovely side of roasted carrots and parsnips. I took on the bahn mi sandwich and fries. I think they were going for the foie gras texture by having only marinated tofu on the bahn mi, but ultimately it ended up tasting more grainy and sour than smooth/creamy. Fresh cilantro and a longer grill time for the tofu would help get those texture issues resolved. The spouse pronounced the short rib \"decent,\" but thoroughly enjoyed the carrots and parsnips.\n",

The charcuterie/cheese plate had a varieties to pick from. The mortadella mousse was \"mwah\" on point. I did not remember much from others that we ordered. For entrees. The pork chop had a nice seared crust while still had a juicy and tender center. But the side of mustard greens were waaay salty. The hanger steak was mediocre. I have had better.

The crust that did not have any toppings, however, was so hard that it cracked when I would try to bite it, and actually left the roof of my mouth a little torn up because I am not smart enough to stop eating pizza when it is in front of me.\n",

Although, it is onlly 1/3 pound, FLIP makes their burger with a smaller diameter, so that the patty is thicker =) The flavors are unique, well flavored,  and tantalizingly delicious.

            "4 stars. Food was excellent! Just delicious and the beers were good but the cocktails, well, they need some work. Also the hostess, she is amazing! The rest of the staff is super nice but a little disorganized. Finally it is hot there and AC would be nice but those little details aside would 100% go again! Definitely worth it. Get the 3 meat plate and masir\n",
            "Falafel is amazing. However gyro meat is not crispy on the outside. As a tender moist meat, they do well but it needs a crisp ! This is basic... and they also charge quite a bit. So, stick with falafel and hummus (it is good, but tarbouch is the best hands down). Gyro, go to uber eats and get Gyros Gr authentic Greek food. Much cheaper, and they deliver also crispy meat.\n",
            "I tried Solstice for the first time yesterday and I was a little surprised.  Went late afternoon Sunday and sat out front on the patio-esq area.  Service was fine (we were really the only ones there).  I ordered the Chicken sandwich and my friend had the openfaced roast beef with bluecheese.  Both were really good, the bread was crispy and flavorful and the pesto was a perfect compliment to the chicken.  The salad with the nuts and strawberries was also really good, am usually skeptical about fruit combo with salads but was great with a balsamic dressing.  Okay the only complaint that I had was with the coffee, I should note that I work for a coffee roaster so my expectations are pretty high and I am a purist about my espresso.  I ordered a latte and it was a small glass with a huge amount of whipped cream and spices of all sorts on it.  ugggh, I could not even drink it barly tasted the espresso, The waitress noticed this though and I told her my problem with it being too sweet and she brought me an unsweet Iced regular coffee and it was pretty good and I got my fix for the day.  All in all a great afternoon lunch spot I will be returning.\n",

            "I frequent this restaurant quite often and order the Sushi Special C - dynamite roll, kappa maki and yam tempura roll, in addition to miso soup and salad.  It is a great value and plenty of food.  The restaurant itself is very tight, and the servers are not always the friendliest, but I come back like a loyal dog constantly.  Take out is highly recommended if you do not want to deal with hecticness of the closet-sized space.\n",
            "I love this place.   There are times when I need a decent bottle of wine and a quick snack on my way home but I cannot bear the idea of dealing with the crowded grocery store.  This market never disappoints.  It is not cheap, but neither are other convenient stores and they have barely a fraction of the selection.  Thanks for being convenient and awesome, Live Oak!\n",

The price is also not outrageous like some of the others. I will be back. The baked beans are very tasty not to sweet and the Mac and chees is creamy and polly cheesy..\n",

Try graham crackers, mangos, Hershey's bars, whatever your heart so desires! Oh, yeah, they also have pizza and wraps. But in my opinion, the fro-yo is the reason to go.\n",
            "Couple buddies and I were roaming around Robson street trying to decide where to eat for dinner and stumbled upon Tropika, and it was a pleasant surprise!  I loved their Roti Canai bread as a starter! We also tried several other dishes such as hainanese chicken and spare ribs, on top of their coconut rice! it was delicious!\n",

            "Sweet filling delicious breakfast place.  The taters were quite good and my omelete/scramble whatever it was had lots of goodies on it.  Hot, strong coffee accompanied and all for a reasonable price.  I have not tried the scotch eggs yet, but everyone is raving about them.  Word.\n",
            "Short wait, good ambience, good service. Server recommended the crostini and it was good, but half the bread would have been better. Got the carmine/tartufo pizza with fresh arugula on the side, which was tasty as well. All in all, good place to drop in if you want good food without the wait of some of the nearby touristy places.\n",

The food is scrumptious and I recommend going all our for the prix fixe menu - three delicious courses for only $30! I went for a friend's birthday, and we overtook half the restaurant. The service was good and I appreciate how they added a special touch in the details, for example the birthday girl got to develop a select menu for her guests that evening from the larger menu.\n",
            "I had not been here since I was much younger, but my gf got a coupon in the mail for a free entree, so we stopped up there early on a weekend.  We were not able to sit down in the dining room, but there were 2 open seats at the bar, so we swooped those.  Bartender was on point, my gf's dirty vodka martini was good.  \n",

            "I really like the food here! They have great veggie options! I work nearby so I like to come here to get a quick sandwich and maybe a coffee. They serve Water Ave. coffee, so that is cool! I like the vegan sandwich. I do not think I would come here to sit for a long time because the decor is kind of busy and messy. I saw other people working on their computers here though, so maybe it is just me :)\n",
            "I have gone here many times.  I have done the Friday night fondue three times now.  Sometimes the chocolate is hotter and thicker then other times.  I wish it was more consistent.  I have ordered the Lobster Bisque a few times as well.  It is not the best I have ever had but it is still good and is a great accent to a sandwich.  On Mondays children eat for 1.99 and get free ice cream.  This is a hit with my son (and my wallet)! The peanut butter pie is VERY good as well.  I also highly recommend the mint chocolate martini.\n",

            "Awesome crepes place, it is good and it is cheap.  Not to mention that it came with ice cream as well.  Compared to most places in Seattle which charge you $6-7 dollars for just a banana and nutella crepe, this place is a steal.  It is a little hidden though, we drove past it and had to come back around.\n",

            "The food menu has a lot of variety. When at a bubble tea place, I always opt for the thick slice of super-white bread drenched in condensed milk. I tasted a hint of butter underneath the condensed milk this time. Delicious! It is sweet, unhealthy, and deliciously bland. Mmmmm. Love it. \n",

            "Cha Ba Thai has yet to let me down. Whether it is curry or noodles, they have figured out what makes mouths happy. I normally like Thai food, but I rarely suggest it as an option. It usually needs to be suggested by someone else. But not with Cha Ba Thai. I find myself looking forward to going there to try other dishes or maybe just tuck into the Green Curry once again.\n",
            "Their happy hour is fantastic. We tried almost everything on the menu, ordered 4 drinks, and spent just a tad over $70. The only thing we did not love were the shishito peppers - it was kind of bland and needed salt or soy sauce. I loved their take on the ceviche. The seafood was served in clam shells and the sauce was creamy and sweet. Really delicious. I think my new favorite place to get ceviche now! The shrimp cocktail came with HUGE pieces of shrimp that were plump. I am in love with the Gatsby cocktail drink. I have not stopped raving about it to everyone and have converted from a vodka drinker to a gin drinker. I also tried the Punch Drunk Love cocktail but that did not compare to the Gatsby. My friend ordered a Sangria and it was served in a very tall wine glass. She said it was very strong and I had to help her drink it! Nonetheless we left pleasantly full (not overstuffed) and a bit tipsy. Cannot wait to bring my husband here next time.\n",
            "Oh so delicious. We stuffed ourselves so much eating dinner here! The two of us ordered 6 plates and 4 drinks (those happy hour drinks! Lol) and we really liked the food!\n",

I ordered the red waffles and fried chicken it was good with the strawberry syrup but there definitely should have been more chicken. The service was kind of horrible/slow. The waiters made promises they could not keep such as the bottomless mimosas time slots. Other than that It was a cool spot to jam out and eat brunch. I support black owned businesses!\n",

Second time was for lunch on a Saturday and the pizza did not come out nearly as good as the first time, but it was still a good pizza. Just seemed slightly undercooked compared to the first experience. Convenient location to I-285 and GA 400. It is definitely worth a visit!\n",

Indoor/outdoor so I imagine it can get hot - but the food was really good, drinks were reasonably priced. They have a lake view and chairs set up outside to enjoy a beautiful, Florida sunset and it is a nice change of pace from Vanberry's across the street that is always so busy. \n",

With a $2 slice of the \"I can be your gyro\" special, a half Greek salad, garlic knot and beer for $11.25, there was not much to complain about. Service was fast and friendly and everything tastes great. It was also lovely to have an outside seating option on what was one of the first days that actually felt like spring!\n",

Food is good, prices could be a little cheaper for a sports bar...$10.99 for 10 wings is a little crazy I AM GOING TO.  Maybe bacause it is in the Mall of Millenia area too is another reason prices are slightly elevated.  Good news is that beer prices are decent.  BOGO 22oz coors lights are $6.50 for 2.  or $3.25 a beer...not bad.  Anyways, I will be back and hoping one will get built closer to Disney.\n",

Let me reiterate...none of the beers were bad. In fact they were all quite good, but there just was not anything that really stood out above the crowd of the plethora or beers coming out of Austin. The OFest was a good standard Maerzen, malty and sweet with a nice underlying nuttiness. Extremely drinkable and probably my favorite from the current selection.

Lunch yesterday  I had the jumbo shrimp with linguine which was very good.  There was no vegetable included with it which I felt was a draw back and $7.95 for a salad added to the already $15.95 for the entrée I thought was too much just to add a little healthy touch to the meal.   I liked the fact that the coffee and tea were served in a good size cup which held the heat better.  I was with a group and we asked if we could have separate checks and were told they did not do it.  This is often a major inconvenience to group dining and often inhibits what you might order if you are trying to divide a check.   I could hear the people at the next table also requesting it and being denied.  Should this not be about the customer? \n",

There were some tasty little frittery type things with raitas - the yoghurt raita was nice when I mixed it with a cilantro type.  They offered rice and then a variety fo vegetarian dishes.  A lovely lentil dish that tasted earthy and complemented the chicken dish I tried.  I also tried the spinach with paneer, and a marsala of vegies that was good.  (They did use canned green beans but the spice was great)  The tandoor chicken was grilled perfectly with a smokey grill flavor but the chicken was not a bit dry.  I passed on the mutton curry - only because I was getting full.  Naan came fresh and hot.  And the little dough balls in the saffron honey sryup was wonderful.  I had to stop eating.\n",

Amazing. I have never played mini golf on a course like it. We kept saying \"WOW!\" at each hole. Absolutely worth the $5 to play. Between dinner, golf and the arcade, it was the most fun we have had as a family in a long time.\n",
            "This is the second Thai Dish in Boston, so do not be confused. The other one is on Newbury Street. This one is in the basement, below a camera store, so you will probably walk past it a few times before you get there. I got take-out, so I cannot speak to the service, but the Rama Thai Garden was awesome, with a delicious sauce, a wide range of vegetables, and tons of chicken. Too bad they do not have one of these in SF.\n",
            "Great Burritos, great tacos, and great fajitas.  I love the food hear all around.  Small beer selection but that is probably because they are mostly Mexican beers, one or two I had never heard of which I think is pretty cool.  I sometimes wish it was slightly cheaper but that is possibly because I am a poor college student.  Think... Au Bon Pan but Mexican food.  You even get to direct every ingredient that goes into your food. YUM.  Also the only place on Northeastern campus that sells alcohol to my knowledge and they have lots of TVs and one huge projector screen for sporting events.  Check it out.\n",

            "It was hot out and I needed something light for lunch. The place was busy, but the staff was fast, friendly and majority of them were not Vietnamese. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the Pho, which a lot of patrons had ordered.\n",

            "\n",
            "The BBQ pork was delicious! Perfectly charred and in a huge bowl. The black pepper and lemongrass were on the verge of being overpowering, but I think the massive amount of noodles and vegetables helped. I was pleasantly surprised because this is the first place where the noodles came out warm. I am not sure if that is what caused a lot of breakage in the noodles, but it was still good.\n",

            "My eyes were bigger than my stomach because I ordered the Tri-Colored dessert with mung beans, red beans, pandan jello slices and coconut milk. It is usually served with shaved ice, but this came out with ice cubes. It was a little sweeter than I am used to, but just what I needed after such a flavorful lunch. They put the rest in a foam cup for me to take home and finish later.\n",

            "Wait, wait, wait. This is a non-meat restaurant? I took five carnivores, me included, to try this restaurant out because it was next to the AirBnB we were staying at and we walked out of that place none-the-wiser. \n",

It did not work.  Fire and smoke began to envelop the restaurant.  The patrons were evacuated.  We stood out in the rain and watched several fire trucks pull up.  Firemen with axes ran into the restaurant.  It was awesome.....well, for the patrons.  I am sure the restaurant and Buckhead Life management probably do not find it quite as awesome.  There was so much smoke and fire that we soon learned the restaurant would be closing for the night.\n",

            "\n",
            "Mushroom toast: the description, or lacktherof made me really interested in this dish.  It is basically some toast, with two soft boiled and then deep fried eggs, with two kinds of mushrooms in a dark gravy with kale.  It was SO GOOD.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Fish and chips: your standard fish and chips but just a little better.  The duck fat fries are nothing new to me- I am a regular at the best belgian and french restos. They were done about as good as any other fries- nothing too special.  The Fish was a lighter variety- not big and meaty but still good- the batter was good.  It was almost Chinese style.. when you  have it you will know what I mean.  It is not as heavy as other batters, but it is not a panko like a japanese batter.  it is right in between.\n",
            "The weird thing is that it came with mushy peas..but just..mashed up peas.  I understand that that is a brit thing but they were completely unseasoned.  Just mashed fresh peas... weird. Whatever.\n",

            "the portions are good- they are just a tad more than you should eat for one meal.  However, I would actually rather pay a little less and get a slightly smaller portion of food.  Just my preference though.  Other things on the menu looked good as plates were coming out.  I would come back again after they change up their menu.  \n",

            "They serve the best donuts in all of Boston. I especially love the Boston Cream donuts. Their breakfast croissants are yummy! The staff is equally as pleasant. If you go here, you will never go to Dunkin again.\n",

We got the baked spicy scallop roll, the blue crab roll, and the spicy flaky tuna roll.  The rolls were all excellent (and fresh), but they were a little small by west coast standards.  For dessert we had the deep fried green tea ice cream, which was really yummy (and looked like a giant kiwi!).  No real complaints!\n",

The Mac and cheese was very cheesy, though a bit high in the grease factor. The butternut squash was perfect;  crisp tender and delicious.  All in all, a nice dining experience.\n",

            "Had lunch at our new Lucky's today with two friends. This place has only been open for about 3 weeks and we wanted to give it a try. We were all impressed. I had the club sandwich on toasted whole wheat bread. It was enormous -- I could only eat 1/4 and took the rest of it home for later. The sandwich was very good -- my only complaint is that there was SO much turkey stacked onto the sandwich that it somewhat overwhelmed the nice taste of bacon and tomatoes. It came with french fries and slaw. The fries were really awesome; very fresh-tasting and cooked perfectly. I seldom make much mention of french fries but these were truly excellent. The slaw was cabbage in a somewhat soupy and sweet dressing; not my favorite type of slaw, so next time I will skip it and try something else. The menu is quite large and varied and there are plenty of other items that look worth trying.\n",

            "I do not know how a big $3 beans, rice, cheese, and chips plate to go with your drink can be anything but good. It seriously just gets better when you pour on the Tapatio and put on Motown, Neko Case, Jesus & Mary Chain, and Justin Timberlake all in succession on the jukebox.\n",
            "This super casual coffee shop/bar has a pretty dang good location.  It sits right on the bike thoroughfare of N Williams and borders a reclaimed garden space it uses for its outdoor seating.  There are few tables in the small patio area, and no smoking, but feel free to wander the slightly overgrown and interesting garden path with your beer or coffee. In the late spring and early fall the sun warms the unshaded seating area to the perfect temperature and leaves you with the feeling of hanging out in your friend's back yard.\n",

Random furniture arrangements offer both comfy couches and the more standard 4-tops.  Nothing matches but it offers something for everyone.  You do not have to fight for a seat, but there is always a buzz of some activity in the evening hours.  I am pretty sure they would never kick someone out for overstaying their welcome, so put up your feet, send some emails and relax for a couple hours.\n",

            "They offer both vegan and non-vegan food options on a short but sufficient menu.  The food can be hit or miss, but is generally pretty good for the price and is always fresh.  The Cozy Pies are DELISH and the yellow curry is dependably yummy.\n",

            "Uchiko has a sweet happy hour and is -the- place to go when you are celebrating any occasion that can be considered remotely \"special.\" Even though it is hidden in a random strip mall in Rosedale that also houses a Taco Deli, Uchiko is not your typical neighborhood shop. Walk in, and you will be greeted with a dimly lit and modern interior equipped with the cluster-of-lightbulbs chandeliers. \n",
            "\n",
            "Their happy hour is a great value. The variety and innovation offered from their happy hour menu is solid, and the prices are not too bad either. You will probably spend around $20-30 a person, but note that it is a step down from their regular menu quality-wise, unlike uchi. Try the yokai berry and also the brussel sprouts, ham & eggs, and fried eggplant. \n",

            "\n",
            "While most restaurants treat dessert as an afterthought, at Uchiko, it is a dream. The tobacco cream hosts trifecta of vices: tobacco, scotch, and dark chocolate, while the fried milk is a supercharged, fancier version of cereal and milk. \n",
            "\n",
            "Other notes: try the cocktails, they are great; always make a reservation, and if you are there for happy hour, make a note when you reserve because HH seating is very limited; and anything off the special menu is a solid bet.\n",
            "I have very mixed feelings about Pour Bistro after visiting a handful of times. I want to love it. They have a small patio that is ideal for spring and summer weather. They also have begun allowing dogs on the patio as the laws just changed to allow animals on patios. Another plus is their selection of by the glass wines. \n",
            "\n",
            "However, for a few reasons, I just cannot love it. Their prices...I just do not get them. Their price for a glass of wine is definitely overpriced compared to other restaurants in the city. Their appetizers have always been satisfying but certainly overpriced. I would even recommend serving half the amount, lowering the price and therefore  encouraging small groups (2-3) to order more than one appetizer instead of feeling like they should just order one thing due to the high prices. I also was not super impressed with their cheeses. It felt like they just purchased them from Whole foods and threw them on a plate without much thought. \n",
            "\n",
            "All in all, I am sure I will be back (multiple times) but mainly because it is the most convenient wine bar to grab a glass of wine with a girlfriend. Not because someone could not outdo them if they tried.\n",

After looking at the menu (every time), got the same thing I always get. The Bacon Cheeseburger  and a bag 'o chips. It was the Friday special so it was $5.09. \n",

I absolutely love their Spider Roll and Maple Roll, which is spicy tuna with tempura bits topped with spicy salmon. My friend swears by their Scallop Magma Roll, which has spicy tuna topped with chopped scallop, masago and their original black sesame sauce. Another friend recently tried their Mango Roll, which has crab meat & cucumbers topped with fresh mango slices drizzled in mango sauce, and loved it. And with most of these under $10, absolutely affordable and a great find. \n",

On this trip, I ventured out to try the \"TurboQ\" Tavern Double - \"Triple S\" sauce = kind of smoky, a little sweet BBQ sauce, and Pepper Jack cheese.

I would prefer if there was a tad more potato to make it more of a complete meal. The benny is only offered on Saturday's unfortunately. The tomato bisque tasted out of a box. It was alright.

            "My partner and I tried this restaurant last night and I had high hopes for a hearty Southern meal (I am a Southern boy!). After my initial disappointment of their entree selection ( I was really hoping for something truly Southern!), we decided to go for a bunch of appetizers and sides and we were delightfully impressed. With the exception of the Oysters Rockefeller (we should have known better thatn to order out of season!), everything we had was delicious!! The House made sausage were a perfect compliment to the red beans and rice and the Collard greens were off the hook! We started with the nice and spicy crawfish pie, and ended with one the yummiest desserts in recent memory- the ice cream sandwich! People say that dessert can make or break a meal and this definitely took mine to a new level! I can still picture myself sopping up the amazing caramel sauce with every bight of the oatmeal and praline ice cream sandwich! Eat this!\n",

Please you have not lived until you have tried the Pina Colada stuffed French Toast, the dish is simply amazing and truly a melt in your mouth savory experience. So yes to Keke's every time!\n",

My kids ate all my Le Complet breakfast steak, so I am guessing it was delicious. The Fricasse was not that good. Tasted like burnt dry meat. My kids devoured 6 waffles. The passion fruit dip was amazing. The milk chocolate lavender dip was gross. My wife's salted caramel latte was perfect. My black coffee was what I needed after waiting an hour to eat. Overall, I would come back if the line was shorter.\n",

Happy hour food- $5 pizzas of course! Yum! Our choices were: pepperoni, Margherita, and Italian Sausage Pizza. We picked and shared the sausage pizza and the Penne Rustica. Absolutely tasty! Oh, we also got a loaf of bread as well! YUM! Total on our bill: $19.00. Probably the cheapest dinner I have had in a while, given we DID share everything... it totally filled us up! The service was great, she came and refilled our water when it was low; she checked on us every so often to make sure everything was okay. What more can we ask for?\n",

The steak egg rolls are heavenly, the mini tuna tacos are little bites of deliciousness, and I still have sweet dreams about the Mac and Cheese. And do not even get me started about the desserts! Except for the chocolate cake - make sure you plan to share! The coconut cream pie was big enough to smash into someone is face, but still delicious and creamy. The chocolate cake is actually a normal person size, but do not let that fool you, best things come in small packages! But the nutella bread pudding - oh. my. god. Warm, gooey, sweet, delicious, just everything. Service is also always top notch and the waiters are very helpful. \n",

Instead, I just put a note up to inform Yelpers of a Grand Opening event the store is having this coming weekend (keep reading for further details).\n",

            "I had my first NYPD Pizza experience tonight and must say that the food is very good. I picked up two small pizzas (10\" size, about the same size as a small pizza you can buy at the grocery store), one of which was a Mariano (olive oil, fresh tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil leaves and mozzarella cheese) and the other being plain cheese. I enjoyed both, though nothing really sets the plain cheese apart from many other I have had. The crust is very good, though. (It was on both pizzas I tried.) It is light and crunchy and has the look of a croissant, though it is not as flaky or buttery. I really enjoyed the Mariano pizza. It was very tasty and I would likely try it again sometime, though there are many other \"specialty\" pizzas on the menu that I would also be open to trying, so we will see.\n",

            "The 10\" pizza prices range from $5.99-$7.99, and the \"specialties\" from $13.99-$24.99 (that $24.99 price is for an 18\" stuffed pizza, though). The menu also has appetizers, soups and salads, calzones, pastas, heroes and more on it. NYPD even has zeppoles - if you have not had one of these before, check one out here! I have not had one at NYPD but did at a few other establishments and I am sure they are delicious no matter where you get them. \n",

            "The restaurant seems pretty nice and is in the spot that used to be (I think?) American Pie. (I never got to try that place.) The inside is clean (well, it just opened) and spacious, and there are several booths and maybe 10 or so tables for parties dining in. There are several TVs inside; I noticed one above and in front of the kitchen area (though you would have to be sitting at a booth or table to see it well), and there is at least one TV in the corners of the restaurant closest to its entrance. The staff seems friendly; one server walked by me and greeted me, and the one who got me the pizzas and took my payment was courteous as well. The parking lot outside is of a decent size, though I had to park off to the side a little bit since all the spaces were occupied when I arrived.\n",

When I tried a bit of my BF's waffle, I understood why my friend loves this place. She is vegan and loves waffles, and their waffle did not disappoint! It was very tasty and filling. It was not super grainy, for something that was made with almond meal. It was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, which is how a good waffle should be. My bagel sandwich, which consisted of a spicy everything bagel, hummus, cucumber, onion, and tomato, was a tasty and light-ish breakfast. I did not miss the cream cheese or the egg. It was super satisfying. I really want to know if the hummus was house made or not, since it was great (and would not mind buying some of it.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Only downside was that since there was only one person in the cafe taking orders and making the food and drinks, it took a while for us to get the food. But other than that, everything was great! The cafe itself was a bit small and cozy, perfect to just lounge and have some coffee.\n",

I said sure... happy wife happy life.  I picked up and I said to the guy at the counter, \"My wife made an online order and I am here to pick up.\" The worker said, \"for Jennifer.\" I was handed 2 mini boxes. I left and went home. My wife opened the front door for me and saw the boxes and said what is that. I said its what you ordered. She replied NO. I ordered a mega, not a mini. I have the receipt on my phone. I saw and she was right she ordered a mega. She then called back and said to the other line that she ordered a mega and not a mini. Again this was our first time here and I was wondering that is a expensive personal pan sized pizza. The person on the phone said that they will make another one and to come in and pick up the new order. I was kind of cracking up and wondering if this happens often. But when we arrived the pie was ready for us and the guy that handed me the order the first time was explaining to me and my wife but it was all good. We will be coming back even though a miss hap occurred our first time here. Its kind of like the subway or chipotle of pizzas.\n",

            "In any case, I like the wings quite a bit, though I think the preparation is hit or miss. The first two times they were great, but the third time it seemed like most of the sauce had been absorbed/ evaporated while cooking. Oh well, they were still pretty good.\n",

            "Additionally, the pizza much greasier than usual. I understand it is pizza of course haha, which is why I am still giving  them a 4 star because it is darn good.

Last time I went I ordered the brown cow, \"calamari\" done the right way, this is not tortellini, rye so messy chicken wings.  I have also tried the ramen, Dr. Octopus vs. me. Tuna and the kick ass rice 2.0.  Out of everything I tried I totally recommend the ramen, kick ass rice 2.0 and rye so messy chicken wings. I love the flavour of brown cow but I felt there was not enough oxtail in there.  It just needed a little bit more. The ramen is so delicious and aburi sushi style with pork belly you can never go wrong so go there and eat the ramen and kick ass rice! This is definitely a place I would keep coming back to again and again as I always leave satisfied and full.\n",
            "My hubby and I saw this place on Food Network. We tried the Pork Belly Cubano and it does not disappoint! Great balance of flavors. The bits of Jalapeño did not overwhelm as much as I thought it might. The Pork Belly was incredibly tender but not super fatty. We also got a side of tots. For $4 it could feed at least 4 people. Loved their kettle chips too! Definitely a good place to go if you are in Portland.\n",
            "We went for lunch yesterday,  and it was great!  While I was not sure what to expect,  the prices were amazing - Super inexpensive.! We got a big fusion mix,  literally.

            "I also love their bar - they have a great beer selection and serve them in huge icey goblets. Their Sangrita cocktail is so freaking good with the chili salt rim. And it is a strong drink, too. Pricey but delish. \n",
            "\n",
            "Obviously the only thing I sometimes do not like is their set up - I have tried to go there 3 times in the past 2 weeks just to find a line so ridiculously long out the door that I do not have the patience to wait. If you want Hopdoddy, plan ahead of time. Get there early or go on a slower night. It is also not a \"relaxing\" dining experience. You are in a crowded line, then you are sitting at a table that feels cramped and surrounded by so many people. And it is very loud too. Not my top choice to go after a long day to relax for a beer and good food. But sometimes I just want that damn burger and that is what keeps my coming back.\n",

Our server, Najela S., was awesome! We went to the restaurant twice, but only got served by Najela once, and wish we had her both times! (That is why only 4 stars...we did not get Najela both times). Najela has a great personality, outgoing and exactly what a business like this needs for bringing back people! If we ever get back to Portland, this is one spot we will definitely go back to!....Barry and Karan from Philly, PA\n",

I pulled out my \"buy one regular sub, get the second free\" and headed down there.   I was eager to try a new place as I was pretty burned out on all the places to eat on Scholls Ferry.   I had ordered by phone before heading over there so when I arrived, it was ready and waiting for me.   I also got an unsweetened ice tea as I heard their tea is amazing.    Upon checkout, I noticed they had my favorite cookies:  macadamia nut.   Bought 3 of those also.    \n",

I managed to pick off the bacon and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and flavorful the sub was.   They season it and add thinly sliced onion which give it a real flavor boost.   It was not bland like some other popular sub shops out there.    I was also surprised at the size of their \"regular\" sub.   Luckily, they had cut it in half as I was full after half the sub.   So far so good.    The ice tea was EXCELLENT.    No bitterness at all.   Probably the best ice tea I have had in a long time.    Glad I had bought the large size\n",

I could not decide on the lamb, chicken, beef or pork Souvlakia.  They all came with rice pilaf, roast potatoes, and greek salad.  I settled on the lamb Souvlakia and it was cook just right and did not have a gamey aftertaste.  Yay !! There are also a nice selection of white wines and red wines to go with the dishes.\n",

I loved my dish. My boyfriend ordered the Sautéed Pork Loin with Apple-Caramel Sauce, Rosemary Mashed Potatoes and Sautéed Squash. This dish was too sweet.

There was no issue with the service and the staff were pleasant and attentive.  I ordered the drip coffee and it was a smooth non-bitter okay cup of coffee...not overly roasted and not very strong. This is a great people watching spot if you can secure seating by the windows with all the west Broadway foot traffic.  The only semi-negative was that they only had take out paper cups for their large coffees. The bonus were the washrooms which were well designed, very clean and bright. \n",

Then you give it to the chefs and they cook it for you.  The manager (or maybe it is the owner) was there at the end of the bar, answering questions for anyone who was new to the format and making suggestions on sauce combinations.

I would definitely suggest this place to anyone :)\n",

I did not care for the fried egg but it was easy enough to remove as it was whole. The flavors all came through and you could tell it was all cooked to order. When i asked about spice and how they rate it she showed me the peppers that she uses to spice the dishes, I went with 5 peppers. It brought the heat but was not painful or overwhelming, but i have a penchant for spicy food.\n",

The staff was very friendly and accommodating towards food intolerances. I only wish the burrito had held itself together better. The girl who made it struggled to fold it and if you took the paper wrapping off it fell apart immediately. I managed to keep my half together until I was almost finished. I also would have personally preferred a little more rice. Overall, I really loved this place :)\n",

            "1st ever review...not really my personality.\n",
            "To start I will say that this place's faults are 100% due to poor management. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. However, they are constantly dealing with the store being out of ingredients and more importantly to me out of the tap beers they at one time where known for. As a 20+ year vet of the retail and food industry I feel very bad for the help. They have no support from whomever manages their inventory levels or the business in general.\n",
            "Secondly, this place makes amazing pizzas when they have the ingredients to make what is on the menu. Tonight, 06/17/17 it is 6:30 and they are out of 3 of the 12 beers. This is actually a good Saturday night for them. I have been here when over half the beers were out. Tonight they are out of small pizza dough and they have 2 large pizza doughs remaining. (They will not be the time I am done reviewing this place)\n",
            "Finally, the seating is old and broken down. Very uncomfortable. The place needs a face lift. This is a sad state of affairs. West Linn is very limited when it comes to good places to take the family or to stop and have a cold beer in the evening. The fact that this place has amazing potential, but falls far short of being an even average place to try to eat is very frustrating. If management could do inventory, I honestly think the problem would be solved.\n",
            "I really hope this happens. I love this little pizza place. :(\n",
            "Had a pleasant lunch here over the weekend.  This is a primarily (but not exclusively) chicken place, so I had a friend chicken (tender) sandwich that was quite good.  Crunchy and the chicken was not greasy at all.  The sweet potato fries as a side were good as well.  Restaurant is in Ansley Mall, which though it does show its age is still a fun place to go, hang out, people watch, and take in the crowds.\n",
            "I think what makes them unique is the quality of the bread they use. It really makes the sub special in my opinion. They also prepare and serve your order super fast. This location always gets our order out so fast we can barely believe it.\n",
            "This has been my go-to Japanese restaurant for years. They provide great value and enormous portions.  Coming here on an empty stomach is always a great idea.  The quality is consistent and you will never be disappointed.  It is great for casual dining and for smaller groups as the restaurant is quite small.\n",
            "Great tasting burgers! I just wished they would include fries/salads in the price of the burger.\n",
            "Came for an event which took over the whole place. The outdoor patio and music venue was great as were the staff, but the most pleasant surprise was how good the food was. Would return on a regular night based on this experience. Warning: it is a bit hard to find - it is on the second level next to Taverna Opa.\n",

Normally, you are able to use the discount on the whole check up to the max but they only let you do it on your meal. I like their coffee. They use Oblique Coffee which is a local roaster in Portland. I like that they support their own local coffee roasters. My bf had the corned beef and hash. I had the Bacon Scramble! I have never had scrambled eggs with stuff in it before. It is like an omelette but the eggs are scrambled in! I loved it! I am going to do this at home :) Overall, for 2 dishes and a unlimited coffee, I paid $14. That is with my discount of course.\n",

            "The food here is decent. We ordered a won ton noodle and a congee. The congee was not too tasty but the wontons were all shrimp and amazing. The salt and pepper squid was very tasty but a bit too much message. I think I will head back and enjoy other dishes.\n",

            "\n",
            "The pork xiao long bao had a thin outer dough, with a nice and juicy filling.  The pork was perfectly spiced, and it was not just mush.  A good spoonful of ground pork.  The soup was piping hot, and there was just the right amount of it.  The pork was not drowning in it, nor was there just a single drop.  I actually think it was better than some of the xiao long bao I have had in Taiwan.\n",
            "\n",
            "The pan fried meat buns were my favorite!  Crispy bottoms, and a soft and fluffy outer dough.  The filling was spiced just right, like the xiao long bao.  The green onions and sesame seed garnish made it awesome. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Shanghai styled rice cakes were some of the most delicious I have ever tasted.  A little bit on the salty side, but not overboard.  I like the veggies, and little pieces of meat throughout the dish.  The rice cakes were cooked nicely, and al dente.\n",
            "\n",

The platter cones with ribs, chicken, sliced pork, sliced beef, smoked turkey breast, beans, coleslaw, corn, and garlic bread and two sodas for under $25.  The same kind of platter is over $40 back home.   The ribs were tender and meaty.  The sliced roast beef and turkey was tasty.  The chicken was excellent.  They have three sauces at the table: hot, sweet, and mild. Sweet was our favorite. What really stood out was the coleslaw and beans - both among the best I have ever had.\n",

She was so attentive not just to the party girl but to all of the kids and adults. She really made my niece feel special.  Chuck E Cheese paid plenty of attention to the guests.  If I had to choose between pizza from here or any other chain pizza I would pick here.  It has really changed since I used to take my son to Chuck E Cheese 15 years ago or so.  We had the thin crust. The pepperoni only had one slice on each square, so that was disappointing for pep lovers.  The supreme was good and so was just the cheese.  Games all worked.  What stops this from being 5 stars is the ticket counting machines at one point all of the 6 or so machines were jammed and no one seemed  in a hurry to fix them plus they needed 1 or 2 more at the prize counter.  The girls there could have been friendlier.  Overall it exceeded my expectations.\n",

            "I get takeout here all the time. Food ranges from very good to excellent.

This place blows New York Pizza out of the water and has really good homemade entrees to supplement the delicious NY style pizza. Food is always ready fast, in most cases 15 minutes. My favorite is the favorites for pizza is the bostonian, for entrees I always go with the eggplant parm, which is 100% homemade, making it my go to when looking for good old fashioned red sauce cheesy deliciousness.  All this and more at some of the best prices around, the only thing I would warn against is the dine in option, the room can get crowded and people that frequent this place are quite annoying.\n",

The spice level was not as hot as I expected but the meat was tender, The longer lamb is simmered the more tender and less fat on the meat. This is the only reason for the missing 5th star.

Chocolate cake was alright. Overall very satisfied with our visit.\n",

All of the veggies were delicious, all of the chicken dishes were very tasty, the rice was really good, and the naan was good as well.

Everything was absolutely delicious, and you could not have gone wrong with any of those options. The broth/soup base that the mussels came in was so good that we even dipped our bread in the soup just to get some more of that flavor. The lobster bisque is not skimpy at all with the minced lobster, and that soup is also great for dipping bread. Scallops are ample-size (you get 3) and perfectly seared, although I was less-than-impressed by the spaghetti vegetables that came with it (pretty flavorless and forgettable). Filet mignon is probably one of the better that I have sampled (was my friend's order, and she gave me a bite to try), and the sides that came with it looked really good. \n",

In fact, it seems like they might make most everything on their menu into a vegetarian option if prompted to do so. As a vegetarian, I get a hankering for something from the olden days, without the guilt of eating an animal. So I told the person who took my phone order that I wanted sweet and sour \"chicken\" but with fried tofu to replace the chicken.

Here they did not, and the tops were slightly dehydrated, like they would been standing.    However, they were still very tasty, and the sauce was excellent.  And, the buddha's delight was not to my taste, although obviously well made.  We enjoyed the goat curry far more, and it disappeared all too quickly.  The clear winner, however, was the tuna spring roll.  \n",

The mutsu* or \"super white tuna\" fish was pretty tasty and melted very easily in the mouth. The uni was mediocre and did not taste that fresh. The toro with tempura flakes came out almost like a roll with all of the toro mixed in like a spicy tuna roll. Although it tasted pretty good there was no way to really taste the fish because of the strong mixtures and unfortunately was not really what I was expecting (which was just a thinly sliced piece of fatty tuna on top of rice). The squid was cut very thick and, as usual, retained a slight glossy texture that I enjoy. The botan ebi or sweet shrimp took the longest to make and came out way after our rolls and rest of our sushi did. A lot glossier than the squid, the shrimp is not, as the name implies, that much sweeter than your regular ebi - and it comes with a fried shrimp head (can be consumed whole). Lastly, the two maki rolls were excellent. The seared yellowtail tasted good but not as good and unique as the yellowtail with truffle. The truffle's taste was really apparent in this roll, which is rare in most truffle dishes I tend to order, and so it provided a really nice complementary kick to the yellowtail taste. \n",

I am tempted to say it was escolar due to the physical similarities I noted from the online search and what I ate, but maybe it is worth asking the chef next time around.\n",

            "Food was on par for the experience.  Slightly upscale but it is an upscale mall area.  Cocktails are where they shine.  Excellent bar tender with an excellent stock. Would absolutely come back.\n",
            "We have been waiting for this leave to open after seeing it in Orlando. The staff and managers were really friendly. Loved the bento box! It had a nice variety and plenty of food. The children portions were also well served with food that kids like. There was a small wait but a good atmosphere for groups.\n",
            "Loved this hotel. The bed and pillows were a dream. Lots of amenities. They have a Starbucks on site, nice convenience store inside. The food for the conference was ok, could not tell if it was being made by hotel restaurant but it was just ok. Nice variety of stuff though.\n",

            "I have been here twice - once with my significant other and once with a group of girls. Of course, I had more fun as a group. The restaurant plays incredibly loud music, people dance on tables, and napkins get thrown around like confetti. The atmosphere is fun (a few drinks help), but there are a lot of tourists here.  I agree with a previous reviewer that this is not the place for dinner conversation - eating outside may be your best bet to do so.\n",

            "I have gone on weekend evenings and do not remember there being much of a wait at all for a table. The food is a little pricey, but so are the other restaurants that are in Pointe Orlando. The best thing on the menu is the hummus and warm pita bread. I am sure that many Mediterranean restaurants have a secret ingredient in their hummus because I have never had store bought or homemade hummus that tastes the same.  Also do not forget to have your parking ticket validated before leaving for the night.\n",
            "Wow.  I just sat down to write my review and browsed through some of the previous ones.  Talk about hit and miss!  It is seems as though people either love this place, or hate it, and service seems to be the main reason.  I will share my experience.\n",

            "\n",
            "Service was off the charts, all in a good way.  I walked myself into the bar area, and before I had even taken a seat I was greeted from behind the bar with a warm hello.  I did not know it at the time, but the person greeting me was Ash, who I later learned to be the 'manager' (however I do note that he has also been referred to as the owner in previous reviews).  He was incredibly attentive and provided a warm and friendly introduction that day.  I asked for a beer, and within a minute I had a refreshing cold Grolsh in my hands.  I also asked him about a couple of menu items, and he took the time to explain how each was prepared, and offered his suggestions.  I ordered the Greek Wrap, with South West chicken soup as a side.\n",
            "\n",
            "The soup was awesome, with a touch of heat to complement the flavour.  Ash mentioned that they do not serve this every day, but if it is being served the day you are there, I suggest you order it, assuming you like chicken, and a bit of heat!\n",
            "\n",
            "The Greek Wrap was very good, with fresh ingredients and plenty of healthy stuffings.  The flavours were nicely blended.\n",
            "\n",
            "Service:  Here is what I am confused about, after reading previous reviews.  When I left the restaurant I said to myself that I HAD to take the time to write a review because the service was outstanding, and equally importantly, the entire staff was upbeat, attentive, and seemed to be having a great time.  Honestly, everyone from the bartender, to Ash, to the entire service staff seemed as though they had just been given a huge raise, as they all seemed so happy.  Personally, I had three different people attend to me for various things, and all were pleasant.  Obviously I hit a good day!\n",
            "\n",
            "And the kicker:  As I was leaving, I glanced around as I had wanted to say thanks to Ash for the service, but he was busy with other things behind the bar so I simply worked my way towards to the exit.  Literally as I was leaving, I heard \"Thanks Marc, hope to see you again!\".  (He had asked my name earlier, when I had ordered my beer.)  I turned around and there was Ash, still behind the bar, just wanted to say goodbye.  Exemplary management.\n",

            "There you go.  My two cents worth.   If you choose to pay a visit here, I hope your experience was as positive as mine was.\n",
            "This place was good overall, had the fried chicken tenders, mac and cheese and beans, the beans were way too sweet for my liking but overall a decent meal with good service.\n",
            "Maybe it is because i am prego but i thought this place was really good. the food was fresh and not super fried. i had the garden delight with tofu which was saucy without being greasy, the thai chicken coconut soup which had the right balance of sweet coconut and brothy chili sauce and brown rice. even the fortune cookies were good. they were locally made in stone mountain which is probably why they tasted fresh as opposed to the usual stale taste of chinese take out cookies in the wrapper and they had a slight hint or orange zest. i am definately a fan. it was a little pricey but there were plenty of left overs. oh ya, the steamed pot stickers were good too.\n",
            "if you are on Newbury and trying to decide which outdoor cafe/resturant to try, give this one a chance.  It is got a good menu, pretty good food, nice service and reasonable prices. Their pizzas are delectable with a chewy, yet crispy thin crust that seems to be a common thing in the Boston area (think Upper Crust). The toppings run the gamut from simple margherita to more adventurous ones like Peking Duck (reminds me of CPK in California). The prices are very reasonable especially for Newbury Street. They have great salads and paninis for lunch as well. Their salad prices equal their pizza prices and often their entrees.  You do get a big portion, but it is kind of crazy to spend $12 for a salad. The entrees are ok --flavorful, using good ingredients, but can be on the dry side for meats. Their desserts are great, although on the pricey side compared to their food. Do not miss the toffee bread pudding. If you do fall in love with the toffee pudding at Croma's, here is a tip: go to Trader Joe's and get their Ye Olde English Toffee Cake in the frozen desserts section. Heat it up per the instructions on the box and voila you have almost the same exact dessert (personally, I prefer the Trader Joe's version because it has nuts which add an interesting element to the texture) However, we have noticed the Trader Joes' in Boston do not carry this particular Toffee Cake. We know they have them in California for sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some additional notes: their (music) playlist was incoherent and oft inappropriate for dining. We got a very nice waitress who was quite attentive and very pleasant. When you go when the restaurant is relatively empty it is kind of scary because there are a lot of people on the waitstaff. The interior is nice with two levels the top level is dark and intimate, although it can get a little to cozy for comfort and quite loud. The downstairs has their bar and flat screens. The downstairs hosts the larger parties and can get super loud with the bar, larger groups, kitchen, and TV going all at once.\n",

            "This place is great for a lunchtime burrito - now they even have a pulled pork burrito - \"ancho chile pork\" and it is deeelicious. Their taco salad is a lighter choice and just the right amount of food. I am always wary about eating too much at lunchtime. Their burritos threaten overkill, so be warned. Their chicken quesadilla is excellent as well, with a side heap of some of the best guacamole I have ever had.\n",

Never had something I did not like and every server I have encountered at this location has always been super helpful answering my questions and modifying dishes (I am not a fan of capers or cilantro!) for me.\n",

You will need to eat half the meat with a fork or your fingers before you can attempt the sandwich. Hot deli sandwiches will run you between $5 and $10 - with the Reuben's running around 9.00. Entree salads run around $6.00. Chips, fries, rings, and salads are offered on the side, as is the thousand island dressing and the spicy brown mustard. \n",
            "\n",
            "The food here is extremely fresh - the salads like cole slaw and potato salad are made on premises daily. Their entree salads are fresh as well. They usually have a daily special and at least 4 or 5 homemade soups - the matzoh ball soup is outstanding - and they have tomato soup if you are feeling like some grilled cheese. \n",

My friend got the same and loved it so much he got two, so maybe it is just not my taste. My other friends got a speciality tequila drink served in these really pretty cups. I did not care for the drink because of the soda, but they both really liked it. It had tequila, grapefruit soda, and I am not sure what else. \n",
            "\n",
            "While I could have been more impressed with the drinks, the food was so good! We started out with the salsa sampler, and it was fun and interesting to try all the different salsas. My favorite was the avocado salsa. For my entree, I ordered the chicken asadero enchilada, and it was delicious!! The sauce on top was amazing. I got charro beans instead of refried beans, and that was the correct choice. I am not really a fan of refried beans, but the charro beans were so good. \n",

My son ordered the Hot Ham & Swiss on a pretzel bun with fries (chips). I ordered the Cuban, of all things, with chips. I thought it was really cool that they had Belhaven on tap. This is not a beer you see on tap very often at all, as a matter of fact, I think it was the first time for me. Their beer selection appeared to be very large.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food was great. The service was great. A Belhaven draft was $6.50. All in all, we spent about $39 with tip for lunch. Prices were slightly high, but not outrageous. You must also take into consideration that it is part of the Polaris fashion mall so rent must be super high! All in all this is a great place to pop in for a quick bite to eat. I thought the portion size was appropriate. It was just enough to fill you up but not so much you could not really eat it all! I would definitely go here again. Thanks to the waiter because he was very friendly and informative. Scratching my head on why they all wear kilts but whatever it was still cool!\n",

Strange but true:  one afternoon, frustrated by the lack of seats & inter-table ogling at Diesel, Someday, and even Starbucks, I dragged my laptop and books over to Johnny D's where I sipped at a glass of wine and worked on my thesis in peace.  I highly recommend this.\n",
            "Huge portions at a reasonable price. I ordered the pulled pork hash, which was really tasty. Very crispy potatoes and flavorful pork. My only criticism is that the poached eggs were cooked all the way through (I love when the yolk is runny). It was like that for our entire table of 6. Otherwise, it was a satisfying brunch.\n",
            "To the unknowing patron, Buddha's Delight appears to offer a variety of Chinese meat dishes.  However, upon closer inspection, you will see that all the \"meat\" is actually vegetarian, or various forms of soy protein.  Apparently this restaurant started on the 2nd floor of the building it is located in, moved to the 1st floor (which is where I first tried it), and then back to the 2nd floor.  The big soup bowls are good (my former boss claims they cure his colds), as are many of the lunch specials.  I once tried the all-vegan buffet at Buddha's Delight (courtesy of the Boston Vegetarian Society), and it was delicious!  Not sure if the restaurant offers this on a regular basis, but if they do, it is worth checking out!\n",

The menu is arranged by bimimbap/ traditional rice dishes, your mex-Korean fusion tacos and then the curries. Each entree comes with two sides. If you buy 3 tacos you get two free sides. I had the bimimbap with sweet potato wedges and kimchi. Not bad for $10 pre tax/tip. It is no Jang su jang or typical Korean eatery in Duluth but I will do for downtown atl lunch. I will definitely be back to try the curries.\n",
            "Nice, modern atmosphere, not like country-style.\n",

            "Super good! I am new to Austin, and during my past few times out on South Congress I saw long lines out the door at Hopdoddy and wondered what it was about. It is just burgers, right? Why the line? So last Monday night I dropped by around 7 to give it a try, determined to wait in a long line if necessary. There was no line out the door this time, which was good, but I still had to wait about 15 minutes in line inside. - The way it works is you wait in line to order at the counter in the back of the restaurant, and while you wait, a line-person (not a server - this person just works the line) takes your name and number in your party. They will get a server for you if you want to order a drink. (The beers are great, and come in HUGE, ice-cold glass goblets. -- The name of the restaurant comes from the combo of hop (beer) + doddy, which according their website is the nickname for the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland....  k) When, a table comes up, the line-person tells you what number table you will be at, where it is located and who your server will be. You give your table number to the cashier when you order, and then your server brings your order to your table. So with the long lines, it can be a bit of a wait, but holding a nearly-frozen beer the size of your head makes the wait much more bearable. \n",

I chose the Buffalo Bill (bison, blue cheese, Frank's hot sauce, apple-smoked bacon and Sassy Sauce) at $10, with an order of Kennebec fries (regular fries with a sprinkling of parsley -- or you can choose chili cheese fries) at $2.25 (chili cheese fries are $5.50).

I would never had bison before, and I really enjoyed it.

            "Tried a flight of a few interesting beers here - Project Ale (aka Alter Ego Imperial IPA), the Jingleberry cranberry-aged imperial stout, and the Hot Chocolate Stout, which was infused with cocoa nibs and habanero chiles. All three were excellent, and I ordered a full glass of the Hot Chocolate. For food, we had the seasonal flatbread, which had leeks and apples and was absolutely amazing - a perfect combination of savory with a hint of sweetness. The octopus salad was also tasty, but much tinier than anticipated - the size of a small appetizer. I am definitely eager to come back and try more of their fun seasonal beers and foods!\n",
            "This ramen place is tied with Jinya as my favourite ramen in the city. I always get the spicy garlic miso  ramen with the \"light\" style broth. The atmosphere wins over Jinya if that factors into anything for you - the room is modern and plays hip hop vs the chaos of Jinya.\n",
            "First visit. Kallin was our server and she was great. Opted for crab cake appetizer, blackened shrimp and the halibut special.  It was all flavorful and the portions were large.  When we had crab cakes in Nawlins, they served two in a wonderful, rich roux. Here they were served on a slaw which was good, but not as decadent as I would anticipated. Will eat here again.  Presentation was all very appealing.  Overall, food was very good, atmosphere nicely dark, dining room was chilly, but made for a pleasantly romantic dinner.\n",

I was not sure what to expect with the tomatoes, arugula, and avocado and the broth but it ended up being quite delicious. My friends ordered the tantan ramen and spicy miso ramen and were also satisfied. Good flavor, good toppings, and very filling. The orders also came out pretty quickly.\n",

The restaurant itself is also clean and nicely decorated. Ideal for smaller groups of people (6 or less).\n",
            "Hole in the wall. But wait the food is deliciously delicious. We had chips and salsa which was very generous and served with homemade salsa. We then partook of nachos and tacos with pork meat. Very tasty and I splashed lime on mine. Nicely prepared. My gal had the taco salad. She enjoyed it until she found the beans. She hates beans. But the beans in my opinion added just the right amount of morter to hold the thing together, plus the chicken was grilled to perfection. We also ordered the burrito in the Chicago style. My son began eating with his fork and knife and eventually picked it up and devoured the tasty grande burrito. \n",

            "\n",
            "First bite is the rice, perfectly seasoned. I know it is only butter and salt but bland rice is not worth eating. Next fork is a combo of a piece of pita, beef and tomato sauce. Wonderful flavors. The slight crunch of the pita, a beautiful char on the doner, and the tomato sauce added to the doner taste. I finished my entire plate.  We were served another cup of tea while we waited for dessert. After waiting for 10 minutes, we decide to leave. That is when we were sent back to our seats for the desserts.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "The reason for only 4 stars is the inconsistency. I believe my plate was to come with a salad. It did not. The delay after we finished to get our dessert. It was not crowded but there was constant running back to the kitchen because they forgot something\n",

Open air space has great outdoor lights strung above the space.  Great place to watch the sunset that will not be as crowded as the restaurant below.  Walk up bar with scattered metal bar stools with no backs.  Solid service.\n",
            "I do not go there very often, but when i do, i always get a really nice strong cup of tea.  the sandwiches are good and i love the multigrain bread.  never had i had a negative experience except when i have to wait in line for a really long time because i have gone when it is packed (usually around noon).  i do not think this place is dirty at all...it just has an old look about it. i like the fact that they have rules about wi-fi and cell phone usage because frankly i get annoyed when people are talking on the phone when i am trying to either enjoy a meeting with a friend or enjoy my lunch.  it is rude.  keep your cell phone off when you are at a restaurant/cafe.  that is probably one of the things i hate most.  i will keep going to the Atomic whenever i get the urge to.\n",
            "It is always super busy when I stop by, sometimes the order line is to the door. Food is good and they will bring it out to you as it is finished cooking in the kitchen (so do not expect appetizers to come out first, just whatever is hot). Chicken lollipop is a must try!\n",
            "Excellent food. Tough to get a seat at lunch.  I have become addicted to their clay pot dishes.  My favorite is the chinese sausage and bacon.    It is a very small space, but you can order take-out.  They do not take credit.\n",
            "I had a fantastic meal here on Saturday night.  Nice crowd, but my table was still ready when promised, and service was on the ball.  Food was superb.  I had an apple, ginger, something salad to start, with the artic char as a main course.  The artic char was perfectly pan fried.  Skin was crispy.  Fish still moist.  Great fall flavors (bean/bacon).  Yummy manhattan made with rye, Carpano and orange bitters.  Interesting wine list.   Thanks 80 Thoreau!  My only nit is the lack of detail on the menu, which must be intentional, but made it difficult to decide what to have.  Turns out you can probably order anything, without disappointment, but I would prefer seeing a bit more about the dishes, without asking the wait staff.\n",
            "This is a very busy place at all times.  We came here before 6 just to make the cut on a weekend.  Their dishes are relatively bigger in size, price is fair.  They serve authentic Shanghai cuisine and it is quite tasty and quality is very good.  Service is so so as they are always super packed and busy running around.  Ambiance can be  better as it is starting to look outdated and ghetto-ish. You can use credit card when over 50$.  It is better to come in groups just so you can try more dishes, but make sure you call in advance for a reservation!! Parking can possibly be a problem in that plaza as there are many other restaurants etc.\n",
            "Met some friends here for diner before checking out a nearby specialty bar.  The service at this location was a little less than what I am used to from other locations but then this is I-Drive so not unexpected.  The food was great as always.  I finally tried the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich which I have been eyeing for a few trips now.  Ya, it was as good as it sounds :D.\n",

Two complaints which are intended as constructive criticism.  The Reuben sandwich was delicious.  But it was too stringy and given that there was a lot of corned beef, when you took a bite, the meat did not break off easily.\n",
            "Second complaint was that when we asked to substitute the whole belly clams in the seafood platter with clam strips, we were told it was not allowed, and when we asked to substitute them with something else on the platter, again we were told it was not possible.  I understand the place was busy, but most restaurants would accommodate a similar request.  Customers do not really want to hear that it is not allowed.  I would go again.\n",

            "Anyway, The Breakfast Club is a great place! It is the typical college diner that you can find in any college town, but to me those are the BEST places. They have a huge 80s theme yet play a normal radio (I assumed I would be hearing some classic Madonna). From my tips I strongly suggest getting there early or coming in at 2pm right before close on the weekends. This is a very popular catch up spot among college students. The busy-ness has been greatly helped by the extension that has recently opened! Also it is a bit difficult to understand how to get a seat in the place but once you talk to a waitress they are very helpful in getting everyone seated in the order they have arrived.\n",
            "\n",

            "The two times that I have gone, I have stuck with breakfast sandwiches which have been wonderful. And honestly with a bit of salt they have the best hashbrowns in Allston.

We, instead, went to Hajime which is next door to Rain; it is a ramen shop with no frills. Service was friendly and the food was above average. I did not like my curry chicken bowl but loved my seafood ramen.., if you get it with 100% seafood broth, it is very light and just plain delicious! We will be back when we are in the mood for some good home cooked tasting ramen!\n",

There was a time when this location and the food coming out of it were absolute crap, but today they are the best pizza in the area. The drivers are friendly and the pizza is ALWAYS on time and hot. The only reason I do not give them 5 stars is every now and the. The salad is not up to par.\n",

I usually order the Pad Thai all-day special which comes with a chicken satay skewer, all for $7! The delivery is quick too.  I have also eaten in the restaurant several times, it is no-frills, but quite pleasant, and the service is always with a smile! (often ending with complimentary ice cream!)\n",
            "Convenient in a great location. Their dishes are simple and their menu is diverse with novelty orders as well! The price is very reasonable too! The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that you cannot create your own samplers or order individual dumplings! Try the steamed or fried samplers!\n",
            "My dad loves this place and insists on eating here every time he comes into town. The choices and combination are endless making this ideal for picky eaters and vegans. The food is moderately priced, the service is excellent even when the place is busy. They even have a full bar.\n",

Ours was a pretty standard meal: two orders of garlic naan and an order of chicken tikka masala to share. All of that came out to 20 bucks, plus tax... not bad for a dinner for two (we ate more than our fill), plus they offered free delivery within 30 minutes! The only thing I probably could have done without was the person on the phone hesitantly trying to upsell me.\n",
            "\n",
            "Food was not the best ever, but better than average... next time, we will probably order a spicier version... If you are used to spicy foods, the medium chicken tikka masala tastes pretty mild.\n",
            "Pizza is pretty good, Roast beef is nice - nice medium rare.  Fries are great and so are the wings. Steak and chees is great. Primo's is a solid place for your typical sub shop/ pizza shop fair.  Highly recommended.\n",

It is a nice little food court setup. The chicken was made fresh when we ordered it, which is so nice. Tasty and hot!\n",
            "Excellently made and charmingly presented food in a classy, trendy setting.  The menu is not terribly creative (it has all the good Boston standards, from herb-roasted chicken to pan-fried salmon) but it is well done and you feel a bit cooler for having eaten there.  Dress is buisness casual; a nice dinner for two will run from $80-$100.\n",

There is a sweet-salty taste to it. Friend ordered the full-sized Sellwood burger $9.50. Both were yummy burgers. The bacon hit the spot. Sliders are pretty dang small, you would need to order two to be full. We also ordered the PDX fries $3- not worth. Will skip this next time as it was nothing special. The loaded fries might seem worthwhile, but with that price, I will just get another burger.\n",

I am so used to Starbucks that the taste is a welcome change and seems better to me. But that could be due to it is uniqueness to my palate. They have excellent pastries as well.\n",
            "The Pub is great spot and is just like being in a British Pub.  The atmosphere is great and is not your typical sports joint.  Waiters/waitresses are all wearing kilts. Bartenders laugh at you if you order a \"budlight\" which is acceptable because they have such a quantity of beers from around the world along with Authentic Pub Brews.  I suggest the Pub Ale.  This is a perfect spot for an after work beer.  Bartenders are very friendly and will let you sample the different beers before ordering.  I also suggest the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Beer (BEST EVER).  The place is really clean and the patio is nice as well.  Perfect for a watching any of the world cup games.  I had a Burger and it was great as well.  One of my favorite spots around polaris.\n",
            "I was pleasantly surprised to find this tucked away in an otherwise seemingly-unnotable strip. Some friends suggested it for dinner, since there is a scoutmob for the place, and I tagged along. The room was dimly lit, noticeably absent of the typical bar smoke, just the kind of place I could sit in a corner for hours hiding from cold weather and forgetting what time it was. Seemed blasphemous on such a lovely day though, good thing they have a patio for the \"outdoorsy\" types as well. Our server was kind and attentive, and everyone at our table was happy with their food. My veggie burger was just that. It was not gourmet, but it was not Morningstar, either, and the side salad with beet dressing was better than I typically expect side salads to be. The others at our table were pleased with their burger, vegetable plate, tofu sandwich, and wings. We had no complaints and even a few to go boxes. Sure, as people have said, the place seems to be a haven for hipsters, but I guess I am not the type to let the people sitting across the room from me or minding their own business at the bar ruin a perfectly good meal. I will be back, and, who knows, maybe they will get a fifth star out of me.\n",

We were able to put some posters on the walls and bring in balloons for decoration.  They had no problem accommodating a DJ and sax player. There was an open bar the entire time from 8-12 and the bartenders were very good natured and worked tirelessly making their signature cocktails which were so good.  They had about 5 quality beers on tap.  The hor d'eouvres selection could have been better negotiated.  About 6 varieties circulated and only one was not deep fried.  A trendy space in a trendy part of town for a good night out.  Lots of places nearby to change up the scene if needed.\n",

All three of those items were about on the same level as I would get if I had got them at a normal fast food place.

The ramen here is by far one of the best I have had in Portland, unfortunately mu favorite was taken off the menu , like why would you do that??

            "If you are like me you take food pretty seriously. So you will understand when I tell you that today was a big day. Finally after many years on a whim I set out to find Speed's famous hot dogs in Newmarket Sq. The legendary hot dog cart and master tube steak Chef are so elusive I have begun to doubt their very existence. Only on certain days only certain months, certain hours, and so on...basically not for certain. The story goes that Speed (somewhere between 80 and best guess) is retiring from the calling which he and his cart have responded to since 1975. That is to build a better hot dog. I was on my way to a lunch of oysters at B&G and I though, perhaps an app? The stars aligned, I turned in Newmarket and entered the Speed Zone. No line. Just Speed standing outside and two new trainees on the inside cooking Pearl Franks (the big ones) first marinated in cider then grilled over charcoal. A crispy burned outside and a perfect large split top to hold it. The cook cuts the top of the dog with a knife and in goes traditional condiments (relish, mustard, onions, ketchup), or Speed's barbecue sauce, or chili. Even a special blend of mustards. I stood out there with my partner in crime and ate the over-sized greasy and guilty pleasure. Delicious. Maybe too good. I added some of the \"Dirty Dick's Hot Sauce\" on the counter to the chili and onions on one half with BBQ sauce on the other. Should hot dogs be this good? Maybe not, but there have to be things by which other things are compared. Followed by a dozen oysters each and a wild asparagus and blood orange salad at B&G; Degustation just does not get any better.\n",

This place is always hoppin', happy workers, packed with a lot of \"look at me\" want to be's who spend their money as quickly as they have earned it. Not a bad thing, just a fact. The view is often beautiful both outside and inside(if you know what I mean) but at times it can be almost impossible to find a seat. Dinner prices are reasonable and they pay attention to minor details, from ocean sounds outside to the kids menu. I find it surprising that there really are not many seafood offerings on the menu considering the name of the restaurant is \"Beaches\". This restaurant is owned and operated by the people who own the famous and great Burgerville restaurant chain. Great place to celebrate with family and friends and you MUST try the Chocolate Cake with the Bourbon sauce. Sorry kids you have to be 21 or over to order it. Yummmm....\n",

I went with a few people early on a Saturday just to kill time before we went to the Beehive, and for some reason the host was not happy.  The waiter clearly did not work for his tip, with his service being a bit abrasive and did not care that we ordered a few oysters and some beers.

Tagliatelle also came in a rich, delicious sauce. Knowledgable and attentive wait staff.  Only disappointment was dessert.  Butterscotch pie lacked flavor and crust was wrong somehow, perhaps also over cooked.\n",

There were even one or two chunks of ginger amount the dumplings that gave the meal a more rustic, authentic feel. The rice and beans were cooked perfectly with just a hint of coconut. \n",

It is a small establishment so be on the lookout for it. There is only a small amount of seating so it was good that we were not there during the main rush and our party was only a party of two. It was easy for me to find something I liked on their menu. I got the ROAST BEEF w/ horseradish, caramelized onions, dijon & sharp cheddar. I will say, I am not a big meatball sub sandwich person, but that looks really good. I cannot remember what my friend got, but we both agreed that the sandwiches were quite good. Glad we stopped in. It really hit the spot.\n",

We went to the north end looking for a different Italian restaurant and when we arrived, the owner said it opened at 5pm so we walked around and stumbled on this place.

We did the chili, wings, ribs, shrimp/grits, fried green tomato, hush puppies, pulled pork, brisket, chicken/waffles, cornbread, Mac n cheese, and collard greens.  Now there was not a bad dish in this group.  Reading some of the reviews about the BBQ you might think it was inedible.  Not at all.  The dishes were good, filled us up(nice portions), lots of flavor, meats were not dry.  Maybe it is because we ate early in the night.  For us(10) the food did its job.  Was it BBQ worthy of winning any competitions? No.  But it gets the job done.\n",

The pupu platter is delicious, with crab rangoons with just the amount of crispiness.  The chicken and beef skewers were moist and flavorful.

Our server was Anthony. He got our drink and food orders at the same time. Drinks came out quickly and so did the food. I was pretty impressed since we were such a large group. Kudos to Anthony and the kitchen staff! I got the Roasted Beet with goat cheese, grilled sweet onions, candied walnuts, and mustard vinaigrette ($10.95) with steak ($10). I asked for medium cooked and that is how it was prepared. I also ordered a side of Truffled Parmesan Fries ($8). This portion was huge for a side order! Definitely good for sharing for 3-4 people.  Great food and service! Will have to come back and try other things!\n",

The actual wait to order was not that bad considering how long the line looked! They have a line monitor who supplies you with a smile, menu and order instructions so by the time you actually get your chance you are ready! I ordered the Front Porch and customized it with Lamb instead of beef and added avocado!!! It was really good and had great balance! I also added a side of sweet potato fries which were really good!

My husband and I have taken a number of out of town guests here and it is fun to order family style so that we can try a maximum amount of dishes. We always get at least one order of the taiwanese-style cool dan dan noodles, and we also love the fish tacos + kimchee sesame salsa (crispy hake, soft corn tortilla, whipped cilantro). The corn and coconut soup will leave you wanting to order a second bowl. It is actually pretty tough to go wrong at Meyers + Chang although on occasion we have had a couple of relatively inferior dishes, albeit those are few and far between. \n",

BY THE WAY, if you are confused by the difference between Anjeero and the Sabayat combos, the difference is the bread. Anjeero is spongy bread, Sabayat is more like a flatbread. I had anjeero at another ethopian restaurant and decided it was not really my thing, so I went with the sabayat. I really loved the sabayat here, I was piling the meat/veggies on it and just stuffing it in my mouth. I went with goat because reviewers said the goat was great. The goat meat was my first experience, and the meat was tender and flavorful. I WILL ORDER GOAT AGAIN! I enjoyed the chickpeas and lentils as well. \n",

            "1 thing I would like to add is, that I do not like how they \"penny pinch\" at the cost of the customer.  My bf goes in weekly for take out and last night, I just wanted an order of steamed veggies (easy enough, right?) they said they had to charge him for the tofu dish w steamed veggies and side of rice ($8!) they could have easily made some steamed veggies and charged him a couple of bucks (esp since he is a regular customer)\n",
            "Awesome place to go for breakfast or lunch especially since there are not a lot of places to eat in Clermont!  They are always very consistent and have a great variety of items on the menu and decently priced as well! The only draw back is that they do not have mimosas or bloody Mary's...we have yet to find a good brunch spot with decent brunch beverages and good food in Clermont\n",

It is always crowded when I go (visited 3 times now) and the seating they have outside is always occupied. They tend to run out of the very berry EVERY time I go there too. One of these days I will get to try it! Will definitely be back.\n",

            "\n",
            "Negatives were few and non-significant... first, it was loud (same complaint as the Longmont location - I get that it is part of the \"clean\" decor, but it is loud) and second the bathroom was not labeled real well when you are sitting at the front (that said, just walk to the back - it is not hard to find once you get to the end of the room).  Also a bit confusing about how to bus trays since the trashcans were hidden behind the soda area but again that is being fussy.\n",

I found this place during Restaurant Week (~$30pp, three courses), because it had one of the few menus that was not considerably downgraded to match Restaurant Week prices (e.g., only chicken breast, skirt steak, pasta).  It made me happy to know that they have a similar prix fixe every night.\n",
            "\n",
            "The duck breast is to die for.  I have not had one so good since Italy.  Because we were in a sizable group, I got to try a little of everything - all delicious!  I would definitely vouch for the calamari, scallops, and crab ravioli (small-ish portions, though).  I would also highly recommend this place as a Restaurant Week destination; it is a tremendous value for the price!\n",

The tv's are marked during football season to show which games are playing on which tv.\n",

We especially like the Taco Tuesday deals (99 cent and $1.75 tacos) and Thursday Burger & Brew nights (burger and beer for $3.99.)  We regularly have to wait a while for food due to the kitchen being busy but the food always comes out fresh and hot.  A lot of times we order the wings or claws which are great.  I have ordered lots of different menu items and even gone to the Sunday brunch here.  \n",

            "Our bartender, Sean, was very friendly and attentive.  Maybe this was because there were only about 6 people in the whole joint.  As we discovered, this was a pretty typical Monday night in Portland and not a reflection on the venue.  I could see this place filling up nicely with hipsters on the weekend.  Unfortunately, we did not get to try the food but the menu looked great.  Next time, I guess.\n",
            "Really good Itilian food and definitley competes with some of the more popular reasturants in the North End. Atmosphere caters towards couples (dim lighting, candles on the table etc.) but they do have a good small bar area. I will definitely be back.\n",

Besides the high prices, $7 draft beers, $10 cover and $14.99 irish fare- Shephard's Pie- I really enjoyed myself. Downstairs they played traditional irish music, complete with a marching group of bagpipes. Upstairs was more of a dance party, live band and current themed music. Wall to wall people even at 2 in the afternoon when I arrived, but of course this was a St.Patty's extravaganza.\n",
            "Generous portions and prompt service. I am not a big Thai food connoisseur, but I did find everything very tasty. The decor inside the restaurant could use some sprucing up, but, yet again, I did not go there for the ambience, but for really good Thai food.\n",

Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I have killed a lot of brain cells since then.\n",

This allows you to eat \"family style\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach is not so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you are eating with your hands and sharing food.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I am a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \"perfect\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it is unlikely that I would ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \n",

After I looked at the menu, I am still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that are not listed on the menu and vice versa.

Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \n",
            "\n",
            "My favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I did not like.

            "My experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I am not giving a full five stars is that I do not feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\n",

I had just sat down at a recently available booth in the bar and she was right over to clean it off herself! Customer service!

They have big selections for  from salads, sandwiches, plates and pizzas. I usually go with the Merida salad whole size. I only wish that they include the sugar content of this dish for a weird reason it is one of the few dishes that the website left blank in terms of sugar content.

            "Just had an awesome lunch and great service! Thanks to Juan for his attentive and timely service. Both of us had the Monday special of endless shrimp. This is only until 6pm but what a deal! Choice of scampi, grilled or fried shrimp with a salad and a side for $15! Did I mention free refills? Our order was cooked perfectly and served quickly. Highly recommend this special and Juan if you go to this location.\n",
            "I enjoyed LeChon, but would stick to tapas over main dishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Very nice atmosphere, great surroundings, and wonderful service.  Started with their specialty cocktails and everyone enjoyed them.  For tapas we had gaucho bread, beef tartar, forest mushrooms, burrata, ceviche and brisket empanadas.  All outstanding.  For dinner I had the stuffed beef, a flank-type steak rolled around vegetables.  I found the flavors a bit bland, and the meat was almost raw inside, it was not appetizing.  One of our diners has the bone-in short ribs, they said the meat was so fatty they could not eat any of it.  The other thing was that the main courses came out randomly.  I get that for the tapas, but there was a 20 minute difference from when one diner got their main to when the last person got theirs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall we enjoyed our meal there and look forward to going back, but will be getting tapas instead of main course dishes.\n",
            "Incredible dinner tonight at B&G--everyone from the host to the wait staff and especially the chefs get props. The lobster roll, fried oysters and crudo special were each exceptional! The wine (we had rose and the specially made dry white for the restaurant) were top notch.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our ONLY issue was with the disgusting and truly subpar coleslaw that nearly detracted from an otherwise delectable plate!\n",
            "\n",
            "Check this place out, it is worth the $$$$$\n",
            "They have a range of foods from around South America. I had the Peruvian pollo a la brasa since I have tried that before and it does not come close to the traditional flavor but it was a good and tasty rotisserie chicken. The sides of rice, salad, and tostones were very good. The other dish we got was the Cuban sandwich, it was good but it was my first time trying it. Service was good too.\n",
            "Yeah - they are probably going to be price gauging a bit - but it is a tourist trap. Just, a tourist trap that also seems to have locals coming once in a while, and I perfectly understand why: \n",
            "The food is actually really good, the staff is always friendly, and it is fun to be in a little \"shack\" on the water, that has the cleanliness factor of a good restaurant. The lobster rolls are actually packed pretty well, and they fry seafood up in a way that is not overly greasy - but still satisfying. \n",
            "So yes - it is a tourist trap, but one I do not mind getting caught in every once in a while.\n",
            "The quest for back home Chinese food (New York Chinatown) was successful with our visit to Tasty Wok. It was recommended as an alternative to Mings Bistro which although good was also inconsistent. We ordered a seafood pan fried noodles and a beef with pickled vegetables. The pan fried noodles was near perfect - a mix of hard and soft noodles with just enough gravy to keep the dish moist. The seafood perfect not over or under done. The pickled vegetables was definitely pickled with puckered lips to prove it. Slightly on the salty side but still excellent. The hanging roasted ducks in the enclosed plexiglass area added authenticity to the place. We were initially taken back by the menu written in translated Vietnamese but each title was followed in smaller case English translations. There was a steady stream of take out patrons too. They manage to squeeze in two large round tables in a very small space. There is a small parking lot in the back off Shine but it looked very crowded so we opted for the Publix lot across the street. We are excited about our new find and look forward to future visits.\n",
            "Forever in search of authentic Middle Eastern/Egyptian food, I was elated when I found this place while walking around Boston. Everything is made to order, which I loved (but may not be for you if you are in a hurry), and once my food was ready I dove right in. I ordered the kafta kabob plate and was not disappointed. The portions are perfect but more importantly, the flavors are so on point that if I closed my eyes, I would have very nearly imagined myself in Cairo. The best kafta and rice pudding I have had I am the states, possibly ever. I will certainly be back!\n",
            "I want to give a quick review for the service. I needed to send a cheer-you-up treat to a friend of mine in Boston. I live in NY and decided to see if there was anything better than a pizza that could be delivered. Thanks to Yelp I found Code 10, who not only had several delicious looking items on their dessert menu and could be ordered directly though Yelp, but their service was great! \n",
            "\n",
            "I needed to change the name on the delivery, I called and that was no problem. Then, I realized I made a mistake. As the delivery man, Jose, called to tell us he was at the door, my friend revealed he was at another address! Thank goodness Jose was a friendly guy and he drove a mile down the road to the right place.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot speak for the food, but I can say the treats did seem to cheer him up! Thank you Code 10!\n",
            "I went to this place last night and my experience was wonderful. I had the Chrissy,  which included 3 wings, coleslaw, 1 choice of side (I chose mac & cheese) a drink. In addition, I ordered a small curly fry and a small Cajun rice. The chicken was prepared to order and turned out nicely crisp and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was good, not great; it needs more seasoning. The same could be said for the fries. However, the cajun rice was so good, the best I ever had.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, I would recommend Curly's to anyone wanting a cheap, freshly made meal. I did not give this place 5 out of 5 due to the mac & cheese and the lack of parking.\n",
            "Let us get the milkshakes out of the way first:\n",
            "\n",
            "ZOMGZ THE MILKSHAKES.  You should really come here JUST for a milkshake (if it is too crowded or you do not have time to sit, you can take out), but make sure you are ready for them.  They are super rich and I have personally never been able to finish one on my own (I have more of a salt tooth than a sweet tooth, though).  They taste amazing and, because they are made with liquid nitrogen, they are visually dramatic.  Oh, and the menu changes quite a bit, so there is always a new flavor to try.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the food, it is really quite good--especially the French fries and fried pickles: majorly drool-worthy.  Nonetheless, I am deducting a star because of the minimal veg-friendly options.  I KNOW I KNOW--this is a burger place so the emphasis is on meat, it says it right there in the title of the restaurant.  They do have a falafel burger available, and while it is tasty enough, it did not blow me away.  I would have really appreciated it if there were a vegetable burger that could be subbed into some of the other menu items because they sounded amazing.  If this were the case, I would be tempted to come back to eat a whole lot more, and not just to drop in to suck down more milkshakes!\n",
            "Do not follow the Wahlburgers but tried the place and liked it.  The bartender we had was awesome.  I think we go more to see her now than the food.   The onion strings are also awesome, with a crack addicition like quality.  Table service is slow, went during a lunch one time with co-workers.  Cannot get back to work in time.\n",
            "Breakfast at Thierry was awesome. I had the mocha and my husband had the Spanish latte. The macaroons were so delicious as well as the almond croissant. We wanted to order the tuna nicois but was not available yet at 9:20 am\n",
            "I been an ongoing fan of Tortilleria La Mexicana on Oakridge for quite some time now. Anytime there is a craving for authentic Mexican food I fly over here. At food being under $10 an entree they serve a variety of tacos, enchiladas, flautas, and sopes/huaraches. My favorite day to go is on a Sunday because the mariachi band will perform and they usually have a soccer game playing on all the tvs. \n",
            "\n",
            "From all the items on the menu the best choices are the tacos, huaraches, and horchatas. The huaraches is a popular mexican dish that consist of a fried masa base with your choice of meat/ sausage/ chicken along with lettuce, tomatoes, pice, onions, cheese, and sour cream. Tortilleria uses delicious white Mexican cheese on the huaraches so every bite is memorable. The tacos have a soft corn tortilla base which I absolutely love to order with shredded chicken inside. They also use cilantro, diced tomatoes, and onions inside the taco so you get a flavorable but fresh bite. I tried their enchiladas but was not too found of them since the refried beans seemed stale so I always stick with other menu options.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tortilleria also has a stall of Mexican ice creams and icy cool \"agua frescas\" in many different flavors. Make sure to try the coconut and horchata flavor, you will be hooked! One time I was lucky enough to run into their frozen chocolate bananas with sprinkles. Sadly they only make them very rarely and they sell out quick. Shortly stated this is a must stop for those in need of authentic Mexican food!\n",
            "Who goes to an Irish pub and orders a salad? Well, me, apparently. I have been a big fan of the Burren ever since I first went there  Our last landlord--who happened to be Irish--had a lot of friends & family who played here regularly. It is a trusted establishment, and about as traditional as you are going to find here. \n",
            "\n",
            "Back to the salad: it was the special \"Raspberry Delight\" and among the rich pub fare, was just what I wanted (with a side of chicken). My sister, her husband, and I came here last week for dinner--they needed a \"safe\" place to eat. I love them dearly but sometimes they are not adventurous in the way of cuisine. She had salmon and he had the chicken/broccoli/ziti. Add a couple beers to the mix, and it was a great start to the evening.\n",
            "clean and good selections.\n",

            "\n",
            "Food: Very solid breakfast foods. I got the scramble with three sunny side eggs with ciabatta toast, hash, and a chicken sausage. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were well seasoned. I like mine a little more crunchy, but this was good. The toasted ciabatta bread was delicious, fresh bread. The only complaint I had was the chicken sausage. It was far too oily so I only finished 1/3 of it. Next time, I will opt for another side. Standard vanilla latte. \n",
            "\n",
            "Again, the food was high quality, but nothing amazing.  The super oily sausage docked the food from a 4 to a 3.5. \n",

            "Brand new location. My bestie and I came here on the way home from a show from the airport. I just wanted some home food. This location is super super busy as it is word of mouth now that Japadog is a thing and tourists flying in want to try this. It is similar theory to the In and Out Burger location that is now at LAX, it is mostly people touching down who want to try a trend. I still miss the food cart and small downtown location as this is close to my heart. This one is more on the lines of a cleaned up fast food restaurant style that loses it is charm, however, on the flip side I am proud of their ability to expand in a market where eateries this year are closing left, right and center. The service was fast. Lots of seating inside but busy. Of course I got my normal horseradish and shredded seaweed hot dog.\n",
            "Perfect neighborhood sushi place.  I usually get take out, but they have nice (if not very small) sushi bar/dining area if you are lucky enough to get a seat.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their sushi is fresh, reasonable and very tasty.  I usually end up getting some sort of roll (just easier for take out) but have never been dissapointed with the quality or taste.  While most people go for dinner, I actually go for lunch where they have a two roll special with Miso soup & salad.  All in all, good for date/take out place that will not break the bank.\n",
            "Fun place, great view, good fish tacos, and any kind of cocktail you can think up.  What more is needed\n",
            "This place is great. The food is always excellent and the waitstaff is always extremely nice. They do get very very busy and the place is small so the noise level can get up there. Totally worth it though! I go here all the time.\n",
            "Fate had thwarted two previous plans to eat here, but the third time was a charm, indeed. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she did not hesitate to suggest the carnitas. I hesitated for a second - carnitas are not my favorite thing in the Mexican food world - but after hearing a lot of positive buzz about this place, I decided it would be a good dish to judge on. \n",
            "\n",
            "Well, the waitress was not wrong, the carnitas were superb. Just what I would expect in carnitas done right: Delicate richness, with pleasant pork flavors much in evidence. The serving was massive - even my outsized appetite had a hard time finishing up the last delicious bite. The accompanying guacamole was fresh, the rice rich and flavorful, and the sauce served on the side (tomatillo combined with some tomato salsa, perhaps???) harmonized nicely. The refried black beans did not disappoint.\n",
            "\n",
            "The atmosphere is all funky-rustic Austin casual and service on my visit was friendly and attentive. Now, what to order next time?\n",
            "After reading some of the reviews here I have to say Myers and Chang did not live up to my expectations. That Is not to say it was not some great food but some of these reviews made it sound like this was the best food ever and that certainly is not true. \n",

            "\n",
            "pork and chive pot stickers: these were good, definitely not the best potstickers I have had but good nonetheless.

            "genami fried rice: overall I liked this rice, it was spicy and came loaded with various vegetables and things. There was something in it though that was extremely bitter and unpleasant when you got a bite of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall this was a very enjoyable and different dining experience. I liked the open kitchen set up where I could see the cooks at work. Next time I would definitely try to get a seat at the bar in front of the kitchen so I could see exactly how they were preparing the food. Another plus was having Myers come over and talk to us about the food after we finished. It is always nice to see an owner that is actually interested in what his customers think about the food.\n",
            "Service was amazing, tapas were really great but super small for the prices, also had a seafood pallela which we did not care for and sent back. The owner was accommodating and professional, I would recommend this place for drinks and tapas anytime.\n",
            "Came in for brunch and had a really great meal ... I ordered the Pisces Benedict which was an eggs benedict that has crab cakes in place of Canadian bacon. The dish had good flavor and was served with rosemary potatoes and a really yummy fruit salad - I am not sure what dressing was on the fruit salad but it was light and added a nice touch. The staff was very friendly. Next time I come I want to eat outside!\n",

It is the sound, the size, the employees. My one gripe, like most, the cost of booze. Look I get it, it is Boston, you get the entertainment upcharge, the security that they hire etc... Cannot a man just complain about price and not have to explain himself ?! Other than that, the doorman are great, friendly and always moving the crowds in a organized fashion. The guy alan out front has been there since the day of Axis and Avalon and could not be nicer. I have a real feel of being safe as well, something that TD Banknorth does not provide very well I might add. The sound is fantastic, the multi floors with separate entrances was the smartest design I have ever seen... again only thing keeping the 5 stars away is the cost of booze. $11 for a mixed drink is a bit excessive.... 21.6 pours from a bottle that is $237.60 a bottle gross for a retail cost to them of about $30 on a premium like grey goose... Yeah I like numbers.... that is $207 a bottle profit... again excessive....\n",

            "Baby Doll Pizza has a good variety of pizza by the slice. . .seven different kinds when I was there today.  I appreciate pizza-by-the-slice places like this that have lots of options to choose from.  Some places offer just three different slices (usually plain cheese, pepperoni, and a special of the day) which can be disappointing if their \"special\" turns out to be some whimsical creation consisting of unusual ingredients which do not really taste good together.  Today, I got a slice of a \"sensible\"\" combination with bacon, Canadian bacon, and sausage for the nice price of $3.50.  It was good.  I really liked their thin crust with just the right amount of crunch. . .slightly crisp on the surface and slightly chewy interior.  Also, the crust tasted good on its own, which contributed to the overall goodness of the slice. . .I cannot say that about every pizza place.  There are several picnic tables in front on the sidewalk which would be great for nice weather.  Their inside seating area is small and narrow, and filled up with people quickly since I was there at about 3 of the clock and students from nearby Central Catholic High School were getting off for the day.  That just confirmed to me that the pizza is good at Baby Doll. . .and affordable too.\n",

On the menu there is two different sections, at the bottom of some of the pages in the menu, there are 'authentic dishes' with Chinese names for the dishes. I highly suggest ordering from this section. We ordered about 9 dishes and did family style to share. The tendon was a good starter. For the main dishes, I enjoyed the basil chicken, ants on a tree (it is the dish's name, there are actually no ants), and most importantly the pork knuckle (which is not on the menu). To order the pork knuckle, you will have to call ahead and make sure they have availability. \n",

            "First time here at McCrarys. I have passed by this tavern at least 100 times. It always seemed stuffy from the outside looking. I finally decided to give it a shot. I have to admit the atmosphere put me in the mind of a higher end Cheers bar. I went during lunch so it really was not crowded. The bar tender was attentive but not over bearing. She was cute too. I did not order any food so I cannot comment on the taste or food service. They have a large selection of dratf beer more than your usual tavern. There are enough televisions if you wanted to drop in for a game. All and all nice tavern.\n",

I would call myself a casual billiards player, and I am not good at playing, but I had a great time playing. The tables are in satisfactory condition. It would be cool if they also offer an option to play Snooker. They need to repair the racks to make things easier to store the cues and if they can provide two \"chalk cubes\" per table, it would also be convenient. \n",

The guacamole, combined with the cheese, and beef chili made the the nachos really tasty and the nachos had a nice crunchy crisp. The Calamari dish they serve is also good, it had a nice crispiness on the inside, and decently chewy and tender on the inside. They also served it with some fried peppers, which was also good. \n",

            "Check in was about 10pm (our flight was delayed) but everyone was gracious and super friendly. Our check in clerk (Olivia!) also worked at Universal so she gave us some tips too which was nice! She asked if we wanted to be higher or lower in our building, and I said higher so we would have a good view. When she heard that, she said she would put us on the 5th floor that overlooked a lake (building 1200). The lake view was actually from the hallway that lead to our door, our balcony view was over the pool, but either way the view was amazing! The room itself was exactly as depicted in the pictures we had seen online - all the way to the 8 pillows or so on the king sized bed (we rented a two bedroom). The kids loved having two queen sized beds to themselves, plus their own bathroom. That made the rush in the morning a lot easier to manage too with separate showers. Everything was exceptionally clean, and they did come and switch out the towels and make the beds (we were not sure since it was a condo if that would be provided or not). But you only got the one packet of coffee that was provided on the first day - after that you are on your own. Since we overlooked the pool we had to give it a try and it was wonderful. It was heated enough to be warm but not enough to be hot, and the hot tub was very appreciated (especially after a long day on our feet). The pool towels provided were not huge, but they did the job. Being up 5 stories also helped to prevent most of the noise from the pool guests from bothering us too which was a perk. We did take advantage of the giant whirlpool tub in our bedroom - now that was something you do not often get in your hotel room, and it easily fit 3-4 people. Make sure you get a chance to use it! I would highly recommend staying here, especially if you are going to Universal - it is only about a 10 minute drive away and there are restaurants all around the area. It was a great way to start our trip!!\n",

I requested that the game be put on the big screen since no one was watching it and she was happy to oblige.

When I have a craving for fried chicken, Feed will be my go-to. I am breaking up with EVERYONE else! The Okay: The greens are definitely cooked southern style. If you like greens with a sweet flavor, you will like these. I do not prefer greens seasoned this way. The Bad: The Mac & Cheese should be renamed to Noodles w/ Light Cheese Sauce. No self-respecting Southerner would call this \"Mac & Cheese\". The stark contrast to the full soulful flavor of the chicken was startling! LOL. Anyhoo, overall, I am in love with the chicken.

Salad #2: Grilled broccolini with crispy poached egg. This salad had a balsamic vinagrette and was topped with chevre and almonds. The broccolini was perfectly grilled, and I enjoyed the crunchy almond texture up against the semi- al dente broccolini. Salad #3: Roasted beet & avocado salad.

            "I would heard great things about Sanborn's... that it could possibly be the best breakfast in Portland. It was very good, we will be back, but there were small details that robbed this place of 5 stars. If they had half stars, I would have given this a 4.5 stars. First the good: The eggs were cooked perfectly, almost too perfectly. The bacon was absolutely 5 stars out of 5. The service was another 5 stars, absolutely great. The 4 homemade jams they served to us were out of this world. Coffee, very good. My husband got the biscuits, which were very good, maybe a little on the dense side, but good none-the-less. His corned beef hash and poached eggs, most excellent. My only complaints were the starches. The potatoes were a little soggy and greasy and the toast was stale. All in all, a great place for breakfast.\n",

We went around 7pm on a Saturday night and had no trouble getting a table. The service was impeccable, always at the ready, often offering to get things we did not even realize we needed. I had the lamb, which was pretty solid, but my lady had the vegetarian plate, which was both delicious and ample.

The sauce on the enchiladas was very good! Overall we were very happy with the service our server was Jordan. The only recommendation I have is turn the music down just a little.

My downsides may be pluses for you, different people enjoy different things.\n",

The braised lamb shank was delicious. Coffee creme brûlée had that perfect caramelized crunch and a nice heavy flavor. The blueberry ricotta cake was light and even though the cake texture looked dry and thick it was not crumbly at all\n",

The beer garden has a tent up year round, so do not worry about the rain or that bright orb in the sky, you will literally be covered. There is also a nice well rounded selection of food options. From pizza to ramen to waffle sandwiches, there is always going to be something for everyone.\n",
            "Yes, I have jumped on the hipster bandwagon and have indulged in specialty donuts out in Portland. I do believe Blue Star donuts are quite delicious, as my favorite is the peanut butter donut. While I am naturally a fan of peanut butter anything, this had a great ratio of peanut dust/ to donut to inside jelly filling. I would have no problem coming back here again for the donuts, as I was here twice during my stay!\n",
            "My fiance and I did not have a great experience the first time around at Burtons Grill - our wait time was estimated at a half hour and we waited for over an hour and a half and just walked out, did not even get to sit down at a table or try the food. We were frustrated. I wrote an e-mail to Burtons Grill explaining my experience and heard right back from them. The manager, Debra, was very attentive and apologetic for our experience at Burtons Grill and wanted to make it up to us. She generously sent out a gift certificate to us to try them again. So we decided to go, we made a reservation and I let Debra know we were coming in. They treated us like gold, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. The food and drinks were delicious. My fiance ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and he is a person WHO LOVES cheeseburgers, everywhere we go, he has to try it. He took one bite and looked at me and said \"Best burger I ever had\" He got bacon on the cheeseburger as well and said the bacon was crispy and he loved it! I got the Chicken and mushroom ravioli - delicious! Then we treated ourselves to dessert, and I got the chocolate torte and my fiance got the dessert on special which was butterscotch pudding with heath bars on top. Yummmmmy!! Our server Leah, was phenomenal. She made our \"first\" experience dining there, very memorable. Kudos to Burtons grill in Hingham, they really did a good job on changing our mind about the restaurant! We will be back for that cheeseburger! :) - Also, I got raspberry margaritas and they were delicious! Thank you Debra!\n",
            "Came here the other night due to fat cat being too long of a wait. It was our first time and it was okay. We were seated the moment we got in but we were seated right by the window and it was absolutely freezing. Our waitress was nice. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari and chicken wing appetizers and the flounder and short ribs with two bowls of rice. The salt and pepper calamari and chicken wings were exactly that, salty with lots and lots of pepper spice! It was really good just too spicy for us. The portions are super small even for appetizers. The flounder was really good, it had the 'melt in your mouth' texture. And the short ribs were just as good. Four dishes between three people and we were stuffed! We also ordered the espresso mouse cake but it was not good. It tasted like a stop and shop cake that had been frozen and then thawed out. Definitely put a damper on out experience. We found out about this place from visiting the other establishments owned by the JP Fuji group, such as B cafe and fuji1546. I will definitely visit Kama lounge, which is under the same roof, next time and try out some of their drinks!\n",
            "We have not been to a dinner movie theatre since we got married 18 years ago. We did not order dinner however I enjoyed some wings. The Austin locals know and understand how this place works and would certainly go back for an evening. Next time we will bring the kids.\n",

It is got an urban feel to it that most restaurants do not have around this area. It is always busy but never overcrowded. I went for lunch yesterday and got the clam chowder and the Grilled Zucchini appetizer, which was amazing. I definitely would recommend this to others!\n",

            "This place is for fatties, and I love it. They do not skimp out on the richness of their food, but this also means I usually finish maybe 1/3 of my food before I just cannot handle it. I love them the most for brunch because the place is brightly lit and endlessly adorable. Try and get a window seat because the people watching is excellent (it is Austin, after all, and SoCo at that.)\n",

I also like the Hot Teriyaki. Friendly, consistent service and great Chicken Wings. Hence the name WIng Factory. Yay! I am a fan.\n",
            "If you want authentic Chinese noodles, Xian is the place to go. I would hands down recommend the Beef Hand-Pulled Noodles, which is a light beef broth with delicious hand-pulled noodles. The Red Braised Beef Noodles is similar but more on the heavy side. I am not a fan of spicy and the chili oil in the broth was too much for me. I would ask for chili oil on the side next time. \n",

            "So I am not sure why they had to give you 6 different noodle shapes/widths to choose from. It confused me and I accidentally ordered Vermicelli noodles with the beef soup...big mistake.

I usually have some shrimp dumpings, shrimp dumplings with cilantro, and maybe a beef congee.

They were not bad but could be better.  We definitely will be back but probably will skip desserts and just have their complimentary chocolate cubes.  They Are yummy.\n",

            "It may look like a strip club from the outside (there being no windows and all), but it is not! Inside it is really beautiful and well-lit. The food is solidly good; I have liked everything I have gotten here. They are good at making recommendations if you are a spice wimp, because some things cannot be \"dialed down\" heat-wise. My favorite is their take on Khao Soi, with a braised duck leg and collards.\n",

            "I find Precinct's Restaurant week menu to be unique, as it offers several options, and not to mention that they all sound so delicious! It was so hard to only pick one item for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. So be sure to grab a friend and eat lunch here for $25! Such a steal!\n",
            "\n",

            "As for the appetizers, the burrata was meh, but the clam chowder is pretty solid. A bit watered down, though. \n",

            "The desserts were so decadent and yummy. The chocolate lava cake is to die for, and their greek yogurt parfait is so delightful! It is actually more like a block of frozen yogurt, topped with granola and fruit. It is perfect for a summer day. The size for both were quite generous. \n",

I loved the sangria, the corn, the mini tacos... we lived it all. We had an array of menus selections and not a single complaint. Great neighborhood. The bad part is it does get a little loud and a little hot during summer, but we love it!\n",
            "I went to this place just about a month ago with a friend. She had been raving about the food and the bottomless mimosas. Somehow we ended up going in on a weekday morning. The decor inside was unique and bright. There were not too many patrons while we were there which made it possible for us to have a good amount of attention. I ordered the shrimp and grits while my friend ordered the lemon marscapone pancakes. The food did not take too long and it was DELICIOUS. We had a few mimosas and devoured the food placed before us. I would highly recommend those shrimp and grits. SIGH.\n",
            "We only ever come here for a kids birthday party. The pizza is pretty decent. It is got lots of kids running around and it is loud. The arcade has some fun games and there is laser tag. The real reason for my review is for the the manager on 12/16/2017. I dropped $15 in the arcade never to be seen again. I mentioned it to the manager just to see if some good samaratin turned it in (no) and he offered to replace the money with tokens. I was pretty bummed out about the missing cash but tokens works too since I probably would have turned some or all into tokens by the end of the party anyway.\n",

            "Finally got around to trying this spot on a Sunday for brunch. Arrived around 11:15 and only waited about 25minutes even though it was very crowded. The parking in the garage is free on the weekends. I ordered the Bavarian Benedict, a twist on the classic and it was pretty good. The jam that was served with meal was interesting but good. Will be back to try the pancakes.\n",
            "This place is pretty decent. Everything is local and organic which is cool. The have basic toppings and some obscure items to choose from including Lardo which sort of removes the healthy aspect of being organic but so what it is a burger joint. FB Frieds were awesome. I went around lunch so the place was slammed.\n",

            "\n",
            "For my supper I ordered the chicken pot pie with the fruit. Dang, this pot pie could have fed 3 people easily!! I wound up taking leftovers home!! It was served piping hot, so hot that I had to crack the crust open and let it cool down a bit before I could eat any of it. But that is ok because it comes with a nice side of fresh cold fruit that I could munch on while waiting for the \"cool down\". \n",

            "The service was pretty good. I was amazed at how the waitress kept all of the orders straight, considering there were about 20+ people in our party. Someone actually wound up with extra vegetables!! I will definitely come back here on my next \"special occasion\" trip up to Portland. =)\n",
            "Not bad, i was very surprised. I had a mediocre pizza there many years ago and had not returned because of that. But I did go this March 2018 and the service and the food were both very good.\n",
            "In the beginning I was skeptical, because I have never had Ethiopian food, but accompanied with my food muse, Leigh C, I was down to try a new place. Walking up, it looked really cool. They have an outer patio with a tree in the middle of it, like an atrium or dining tree-house.. I do not know really what it is, but I got a little excited...\n",

            "After taking a fair amount of time to peruse the menu, we decided on the Fish Tibs and Vegetarian Combo Platter. The first to come out was the Fish and it looked and smelled wonderful, shortly after came the combo platter full of all sorts of treats, and of course the bread. It all looked and smelled unreal, so hungry and eager, we dove in. \n",
            "\n",
            "Only one word can describe it: phenomenal. The food was full of flavor and spices. We could not get enough. We finished off the first set of bread with two thirds of both entrees to go. After the longest 5 minutes of my life, we made eye contact with our server and asked her for more bread and water. After another round of bread we scraped each plate clean, and ended the meal with some delicious hot tea and yummy baklava. Probably one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my entire life.\n",

            "\n",
            "So, sure... the seating was not exactly ideal and our server did not pay us much attention, but with food like that... I do not really care. I will definitely be back and I cannot wait to try other stuff on the menu. \n",

            "Highly recommend!!\n",
            "I met an old friend here for lunch and The Parkview turned out to be a great place to reconnect.  The atmosphere is warm and laid-back.  A tropical storm was blowing into town, so we were not able to take advantage of the cafe-style seating outdoors, but the couch and cozy chairs right next to the window were the next best thing.  We ordered the champagne flights and a cheese plate and spent the next two hours reminiscing unhurried.  The service was fabulous, and the Park Avenue location perfect for a place like this.\n",
            "Stopped here for a late breakfast while visiting Portland overnight.  I have a weakness for good oatmeal, and with that being the first item on the menu, nothing else had a chance.  I did add a side biscuit and gravy.  Everything was very good.  They even fulfilled my request for cinnamon with a cute little cup on the side.  The oatmeal texture was perfect.  I wish the optional raisins had been cooked in, but that is pretty minor.  The biscuits were tender and the gravy was both flavorful and plentiful, which nicely complemented stolen bites of home fries.  My portion of the bill was around $8 - awesome.  Everything ordered by my party looked delicious.  I am not a fan of catfish, but my sister's fried catfish hash looked amazing.  She was very happy with it.  The oniony-peppery-yukon potatoey hash bite that I tried was lovely.  The place was small and cute, and I would definitely go back.\n",
            "The store front sign caught my eye as I drove by, Heo Eatery and an image of a pig. Heo means \"pig\" in Vietnamese (pronounced like \"hell\" soft L). Always down for Vietnamese food, so I dropped by later in the afternoon to try it out. The interior is clean, modern, outlets and USB ports everywhere. I was warmly greeted at the counter and ordered tumeric fish over rice with an ice coffee.\n",
            "\n",
            "Food came out in about 10-15 mins, nice presentation, unfortunately the only utensils available were these flimsy plastic knife, fork, and spoons. The rice was cooked with leek and garlic, that is a new one for me, I was not able to taste much of a difference compared to white rice. May have been from the overpowering flavor from the tumeric fish. Fish was good, roasted veggies were fantastic albeit a bit oily, and the pickled veggies were excellent. Vietnamese ice coffee was pre mixed, very strong, you might want to let dilute itself in ice. \n",
            "\n",
            "Had the lemongrass beef banh mi on another day and it was disappointing. For an $8 sandwich it was pretty small. There was not enough pickled carrots and daikon to balance the meat out. Nothing remarkable about the lemongrass beef, the bread was standard and oven toasted, the sandwich came with a side of tater tots which was a bit strange. \n",

Burgers are good, much better when ordered on a wheat bun I believe-I only wish they offered veggie burgers, which are my fav.  Aside from that, for a tiny trailer behind Star Bar, this place rocks.\n",

There are exposed  duct work, industrial lighting, hard wood tables, comfortable king chairs, well appointed coffee bar. Additionally there is an area for you to buy organic mexican and peruvian coffee among others. On this particular day I choose to go with the coffee of the day which was an Organic Peruvian coffee which is a dark roast that had a hint of dark chocolate flavor and most importantly did not taste burnt and over roasted like starbucks coffee. I appreciate a coffee house that I actually can brew various forms of coffee and not over roast everything. All things considered the coffee was good and I would return to this well appointed coffee shop.\n",

            "\n",
            "Customer service is a little lacking.  You do seat yourself, but it takes a min for them to get to you.  I wanted to talk to a waiter several times - but they are hard to track down.  I wish they had the bell-button system you find at other Korean/Japanese eateries.\n",

            "Charming Irish pub with a nice, small craft beer menu and a diverse menu of good wholesome food. Place is cozy and the waitresses have to squeeze by to get around the dining area. But this is a nice little place where the patrons and staff are personable.  It is rare that I am in any bar where I actually have casual conversation with anyone, and the Snug is an exception. This place fills up quick but I think it is a very decent place worth visiting.  I have been here twice and both times, remain impressed, even if it has a tiny bathroom.  I can honestly recommend the Guinness beef stew, which comes with a small buttermilk biscuit.  It is only like 8 bucks and it is a tasty meal in itself.  Street parking only.\n",
            "Had also reviewed CC on Open Table (since I used it to make the reservation). Ended up getting contacted by the owner to follow up w/ the issues we would experienced - SO refreshing when the managers/owners of a place actually care. Have not been back again yet, but definitely will.\n",
            "The food was good and the atmosphere is nice. I liked the rice and the quesadilla. They had a really authentic taste. The chips tasted fresh but they were not anything to knock your socs off. \n",
            "\n",
            "The hostess seemed like she was in a rush and did not seem very hospitable. This place could easily be five stars but they just have a few shortcomings. Would definitely return.\n",
            "I can always count on a good burger and fries at Red Robin. There are always too many options. I tried some kind of burning love burger (no I do not remember the exact name). The burger was topped with fried jalapeño coins and jack cheese. This also included a whole jalapeño which was not roasted enough, meaning not with a charred caramelized goodness. I substituted sweet potato fries. They were good, not great. Wish they were steak fries instead of shoe string.\n",
            "Came on a Tues night and it was not packed at all. Service was a tiny bit slow but there was only one server serving and other were just cleaning and doing refills. Decor is quaint and romantic with an open kitchen style and a nice oven for the pizza. \n",

            "We visited Saturday at high noon.  The line was nearly out the door but it moved quickly - 15 minutes from entering the building to walking out with our food.  I am still debating the price-to-value question, but given the other other grilled cheese I order when I am out is $2.59 at Jason's Deli, there is no doubt that my sandwich was at least twice as large and twice as delicious for about twice the price so I think it is a pretty good deal. We will definitely be back for a repeat visit.\n",
            "There were 4 of us that had dinner at Grotto tonight. They had the restaurant week menu - which was basically the same as their fixed-price special they always offer. \n",
            "service was very good. As soon as we were seated they offered us tap or sparkling water. It took a little longer than I thought to take our orders, or even asked if we wanted a drink. My husband wanted a dark beer, and they had a Moretti LaRossa, so he ordered that. The other person ordering beer at the table also wanted the same. But, they only had one (interesting). They had a Moretti so he had that.  After we ordered, they brought bread with a plate of olive oil with a couple of olives in it. The bread looked like it was corn bread, was very fresh, but was not like typical foaccia bread. It was tasty - just not what it appeared to be.\n",
            "For our first course, I had the Caprese salad which was very good. My husband had the Cavatelle pasta which was very tasty with sausage, cream, peas, mushrooms and pasta made with ricotta cheese in the dough - he cleaned his plate with the bread. The other 2 diners had the Mista salad which they said was good.\n",
            "For the main course, I had the Carne - tenderloin steak cooked exactly as I ordered it on a bed of delicious risotto and some asparagus. My husband and another of us ordered the lobster Fra Diavlo - very tasty, not very spicy. there was only a small claw and 1/2 a tail of lobster and no knuckle. My husband said that it was not a lot of lobster. The 4th person had the chicken parmigiano. Lots of chicken, 2 long pieces of pasta, pieces of tomato and sauce. She said it was very tasty, and took almost 1/2 home.\n",
            "For dessert, we all had the chocolate cake. It is a VERY dense chocolate cake, that was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My husband and I substituted the chocolate ice cream. If you are not a chocolate lover this cake would probably be a little too much for you- but we all loved it. \n",
            "The restaurant was warm. I am usually the one who has a sweater on, and took my off as soon as we were seated. My husband said he was too warm. He also complained to me that his chair seat was hard and uncomfortable. And because the table legs had a lot of 'stuff' going on, there was barely and leg room under the table.\n",
            "The restaurant was very dark, and when they brought the food, I took out my phone (it has a flashlight app), so we could see what the food looked like. I also had to use it when the bill came.\n",
            "We lucked out for the parking, and got a metered space right across the street. And because it was after 6:00pm - did not have to pay. That was a nice bonus. \n",
            "Overall we all liked our dinner, and would return at some point.\n",
            "I have been coming here since 2011 and have always been getting their breakfast burritos. I was bummed out that the prices raised to $5.99 for the three meats burrito. \n",
            "\n",
            "This time I decided to dine in and noticed their salsa bar had more options, which looked pretty fresh. There were a lot of people during the lunch hour so you can tell they have returning customers and constant business\n",
            "\n",
            "I ordered a sausage and cheese burrito and it was just as I expected, Good. Although I wish the cheese was melted a bit more. Overall, I will come here again and get more burritos.\n",
            "This was a cool club.  My friend knew security and we were able to skip the long line outside.  The sections inside are nice.  The dance floor was packed, the music was good, and the people were nice.\n",

            "We stayed until they closed.\n",
            "Stumbled upon this spot near the office that i am temporarily working and i will say that i enjoyed dining here. The place is a nice size so you can either be close to the crowd or have your privacy.. i prefer to be alone and have my space while dining so it worked out well. I dined from here a few times and i will say the food has some great flavor to it.. the staff is prompt and courteous. If you are looking to hang by the bar and watch the game w some apps and drinks, this spot can work as well. There is meter parking outside and i have never had an issue. ( i drive a pickup). I had the burger and was in love!!!  The chef actually listened when i said Medium.. I also had the rib eye which was also melted in my mouth.  Their price was very reasonable and easy on the pockets.... would of gave the extra star but unfortunately the manager never once took upon himself to walk around and greet his patrons. I know it may be a bit OCD of me but i think it shows how much he really cares about what he is doing...\n",
            "Def recommend to anyone is the area!\n",
            "Cold cheap beer. Free range burgers and great roasted turkey sandwich. What more can you want!\n",
            "Very good food. I have only been once. Went on a Sunday and had a 15 minute wait. I can see why though. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their food and it came out quickly. Will definitely be back.\n",
            "We are delighted to be the one of the first customers at the first day of their business. We ordered three rolls: Chanel Roll, Volcano Roll and YOU.N. Roll.\n",

            "All three rolls were beautifully and deliciously put together.\n",
            "\n",
            "We love Chanel Roll the best. It comes with 8 pieces. Each piece was embellished with scallop, tuna and fish roe; perfectly combined with mango, tuna and a light touch of mayonnaise inside the rice. \n",
            "\n",
            "YOU.N. Roll is my second favorite, though the most special one. The roll is topped with a thin slice of slightly grilled beef. I forgot what is inside the roll. What I remembered the taste goes perfectly together.\n",
            "\n",
            "Volcano roll is basically california roll topped with crab meat and crunches. It is delicious; though this can be found easily in other restaurants. Chanel roll and YOU.N. roll, by comparison are a lot more special and unique.\n",
            " \n",
            "I highly recommend this sushi restaurant. One thing in mind is that most hot entrees listed in the menu are quite fusion / Americanized. The prices are generally more pricey compared to other authentic Japanese restaurants.\n",
            "I have been going to the Burren for at least 5 years on and off.  When I lived closer I came more often...now that I am up near Salem, NH we get down to the Burren once a month. $5 cover after 9 or 10...I cannot remember.\n",
            "\n",
            "I ate here once and probably had diarrhea.  I come here for beers, single malts, and socializing.  The Burren's beer tap list is standard (Harpoon, Samuel Adams, their award winning pours of Guinness) and they have a decent bottle list.  They have a ton of liquors, Irish whiskey, Single Malt Scotch, etc. Yum Yum Yum.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their back room houses live bands.  I used to come for that and dancing and merry making.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their front room has live Irish music.  I tend to stay in the front room as that is where my favorite bartenders and patrons are.  My husband and I are always meeting new and interesting people in the front bar.  Plus we made friends with the bartenders in the front and look orward to chatting with the boys during their brief quiet moments.\n",

            "Go here for the beers, the music, and the socializing.  Eat dinner elsewhere.\n",
            "This is the fried chicken you deserve. Spicy and tasty. Flavorful. The sides leave a little to be desired, but the chicken is king.\n",
            "Torchy's is great!!! Large menu with some excellent vegetarian options. I indulged in the fried avocado taco and portobello taco. They have a nice range or mild to spicy sauces. I loved the avocado sauce. \n",
            "\n",
            "Make sure to get the queso. It is to die for! You can look around and see everyone orders it. \n",
            "\n",
            "Make sure you are not in a hurry or trying to hang out. I was there for two hours chatting with an old friend and the line was to the door the whole time.\n",

            "I would have said \"this supermarket is great\", but it is not a supermarket. \n",
            "I also would have said \"this grocery store is great\", but it is not just a grocery store either. \n",
            "It is better, and because I do not know a set category, I am just going to leave it at a very general term, place. Lambert's is one of the many amazing supermarkets in Westwood. Most small towns have maybe one grocery store at most, some none. Westwood is one of the few, that now has FOUR, yes FOUR, stores with a large grocery section. Lambert's is one of the four, being around for the longest, on busy Route 1. It is easy to access as it is located on the Northbound side, but just a quick you-turn at the median from the Southbound side. In addition, the gem of Lambert's sits to the left of the building at the far end of the lot..... the garden center (to be explained...)\n",
            "Anyway, even though they may not be able to check everything off your list, they have a large selection of everything they do carry. Some of the main features of Lambert's are: the salad bar, which has chicken salad, tuna salad, and at least a few other salads. They have lots of fruit and vegetables as well at the salad bar. They have an extensive deli, carrying Boar's Head. Right next to the deli, they have a small bakery section and a small fruits / vegetables section as well. They have a small meat section, and a condensed freezer variety. They have a large section of wine and beer as well.\n",
            "It was my very first visit  the service was awesome and they assured me that I would love the food. And guess what I definitely  love the food  hands down. It was very clean and also a nice bar you can even set outside for that summer  fun. Try them for yourself. I will  be a regular ....\n",
            "I would definitely re-visit this place. I had 3 tacos and plantains. I will skip the plantains next time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tacos were tasty. 1 chicken, 1 pork carnitas, 1 steak (carne asada?). Jarritos guava soda to top it off.\n",
            "\n",
            "Delish.\n",
            "Great food. Nice people. Slow service. If you are not in a hurry, try it out. The dressing they use on the salad is worth it alone!\n",
            "B&G Oysters is consistently one of my favorite restaurants to visit.  Usually I visit B&G for lunch but last night, my boyfriend and I came here last night for a belated birthday dinner and I have no complaints.. Dinner was just as great as lunch! \n",
            "\n",
            "I will start off by saying the host last night was really great at his job.  We were seated at a table close to the host podium and I watched him work the entire night.  He was very professional and prompt and accommodating for everyone.  Over the course of the night two different parties came in who spoke french and he was able to speak back to them, it was quite impressive!  He also suggested people waiting go across the street for a drink at the Butcher Shop since B&G is very small.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We were seated promptly after we arrived and the servers were attentive all night.  Our waitress was great at suggesting a wine for us and as well as pointing out her favorite dishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Everything we ate was great.  We started off with 2 dozen assorted oysters and the scallop crudo.  The oysters were fresh and delicious.  The crudo was my favorite dish of the night and cannot wait to have it again.  For my main course I tried the crispy whole branzino and LOVED it.  I am a sucker for whole fish and this one was served with a delicious dipping sauce that was sweet and spicy.  My boyfriend ordered his go to - the B.L.T. with Lobster and it exceeded his expectations per usual.  For desert we shared a quince crumble.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Over all, it was a very lovely night and even though we were seated close to the door I was never freezing.  The sound level was very manageable and we were able to have a conversation without shouting.  \n",

            "Cannot wait to come back again and again!\n",
            "Upon entering Carlos', we were greeted with a warm welcome and the owner asking us if we had enough turkey, (this being the day after Thanksgiving that we went.) He stated that Italians are not too big a fan of turkey. On a cold day, i recommend the seafood casserole. As the Boston nights gets colder, it may be the perfect dish. I am a fan of the intimacy of the restaurant, and I will return again.\n",
            "OK, it is a chain but it did not disappoint.  Went here two nights, the first had their rotisserie chicken, cooked well and quite flavorful I was not completely thrilled with the mashed potatoes though.  On the recommendation of our fabulous server came back another night to try the key lime pie.  Got To say it was excellent, the filling is tart and the crust is not overly sweet, and very nutty great stuff.  The only thing that did not ring true was the cornbread croutons on the salad, which just seemed too sweet for a more savory dish.  The service was excellent on both nights we went there.\n",
            "Ordered a turkey rueben and a frozen hot choc..\n",
            "Both very tasty! Friendly and prompt service. Well worth a visit!\n",

            "Super trendy great vibes the staff was friendly and knowledgeable the quality of the food was good but prices were sky high. There were so many things we wanted to try but for $12-$15 a peace it seams a bit higher than anywhere in Austin. The flavors were on point but we are going to have to wait for a special occasion to go back because $220 for 2 with one drink each on a Wednesday for a casual environment does not justify it. I suggest checking it out and wish them luck.\n",
            "Had a great evening with our server Caleb. Food was good and Caleb provided outstanding customer service. Would recommend the pretzel bites and ahi tuna flatbread. Dirty martinis with blue cheese olives are the best!\n",
            "Enjoyed a wonderful anniversary meal on patio. Attentive wait staff, ginormous wine list, pleasant guitar duo as entertainment. We both had the crusted halibut. Nicely prepared sitting atop orzo and spinach.  The appetizer parmesan saffron fries were limp and a bit greasy but the taste was good. The house baked bread was crusty on outside with a hint of sea salt, while perfectly warm and soft on inside. This was accompanied with a nice EVOO/balsamic dipping sauce. Since it was our anniversary, they offered complimentary desserts. I had yummy creme brûlée with smooth custard, nicely crusted. At the end of the evening, the manager brought a perfectly wrapped loaf of their bread, with dipping sauce, in a little white bag for us to take home. Super nice touch!  Highly recommend.\n",
            "It was a fun girls' night out. We got there early enough to have a drink before we went into the theater for the movie & dinner. Which ended up being a good thing so, we were able to see the menu before the lights went out! There are lights under the ledge but, to dim to read anything really! We did not like that in order to eat your food, you had to sit at the edge of your seat in order to reach your food and not spill. Overall it was a fun experience but, next time we would order finger foods/appetizers to enjoy during the movie.\n",
            "Great staff and delicious cakes! After having disaster with order for birthday cake at star next door we bought a cake here. Definitely worth the little extra to buy something from a pro rather than the grocer. In the past found the choc frost cake to be a bit dry but the butter cream chocolate cake was moist and a hit with everyone. For a  crowd pleaser go for Rosie's. For something a little different our go to is japonnaise in Brookline. But that is not really for kid's birthday party!\n",
            "It would have been five stars from us if it were not for the very grumpy guy behind the counter. This place makes amazing pastries, very good espresso, and lovely food. The interior is beautiful and comfortable as well. The other staff is very nice, so all and all a new go-to place for us.\n",

While the prices are typical of your average sports bar (read: a little high for the quality of the food), they are not outlandish, and you can get a good meal for under $15. The nachos are delicious, and they give you a huge serving, so that is a good option for around $10. Also, the tater tots with truffle oil and cheese are awesome! I have only ever eaten appetizers there because I have never actually been for dinner, only trivia on Monday nights at 8:00. You can have a team of up to 6 people, and let me tell you, it is really challenging trivia, but that is what makes it so fun! The top three teams at the end of the night win gift cards to the restaurant. Best way to spend a Monday night!\n",

            "The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is for pricing but other than that this place is incredible. The grilled cheese with tomato basil soup is AMAZING. reminded me of my childhood. Unfortunately I have not tried any of the pastries but I have had the cupcakes before from Whole Foods and they were good! I will definitely be back for the grilled cheese and soup but it is just hard to know I am paying $12 for it.\n",
            "Beautiful decor. Food was delicious. We ordered the chicken and cream cheese pizza and the seafood risotto. Our server was very nice and helpful. Very pleasant experience.\n",
            "I cannot believe this place does not have more reviews! Especially good ones. I feel like some of you just do not get aion and lack creativity. Yes I am from SF so it is possible I fall into the \"hipster-foodie\" catagory so many of you seem to complain about. However, I find aion cozy and welcoming not pretentious or stuffy and  I love cafe aion. A few years ago I lived right next door and was ecstatic when I discovered this little gem on the hill. It instantly became my favorite spot in my neighborhood and a welcomed change from the college vibe that surrounds 13th street. Unfortunately, my bf at the time was not a fan (he eats wendy's dollar cheesburgers I might add) and so, I did not eat here as often as I would have liked when I lived nearby. I remember the first time I ate here. As soon as I walked inside I felt as though I would been transported back home to the mission. This place defiintely rivals some of my favorite tapas joints back home in SF.  I later discovered the chef use to work for one of my favorite little restaurants in the city which did not surprise me given the quality and creativty in cafe aions menu. \n",
            "\n",
            "Everything I have had here has been incredible. The fried cauliflower with saffron yogurt...amazing..roasted beets, sauteed kale...most recently I tried the scallop dish and loved it. Be sure to leave room for dessert. I am an a la carte kind of girl and so the little dessert plate with assorted cookies and chocolates is my favorite. My family was in town for Mother's Day this year so I decided to take  them here for brunch and everyone loved it. They have incredible pastries including sticky buns, housemade croissants, donuts, scones, and cupcakes. As a pastry chef, delicious baked goods are incredibly important and a solid dessert menu is imperative to a great restaurant. \n",
            "\n",
            "great spot for brunch too. Love the patio. My favorite brunch item is definitely the eggs cuzuela. I recently traveled around Spain and have to say, their bravas sauce and harissa are better than anything I sampled abroad. So yummy! Oh and great cocktails. Somehow my sister and I came here for a quick drink and snack and left three hours and 3.5 negronis later. Thank you bartender for the b-day cava too :) \n",

            "Very fun sandwich shop in Boston that collects (with permission!) the famous sandwiches of other local restaurants. I had the Bravas, a tapas-inspired chorizo sandwich. It was great - a little heat and a lot of flavor. The potato salad it came with was a little boring, but it did a nice job of cooling the heat from the sandwich. They managed to seat a large group at lunchtime with a fairly minimal wait, although service sometimes lagged (I had to ask multiple times to get my water glass refilled). That said, it is a very convenient location and it is a cool way to experience many different local specialties if you do not have long in Boston. Worth a visit if you are already in the neighborhood and looking for a lunch option.\n",

It is quite loud so if you are looking for quiet and romantic, this is not the place. We had to pay for valet ($17), so heads up...\n",

            "I really like Modmarket and it is in my best interest for them to do really well and open a Denver location so I can go there more often!!! I popped in for lunch a few weeks ago after a ride and had the Simplegreen salad with chicken. It was really tasty and it tasted healthy, like I was doing a good thing for my body by eating it. And for the price it was YOOGE!! I am usually a member of the clean plate club but I could not finish it. I also liked the atmosphere, very modern and clean. My only beef with Modmarket is that they should have dessert, I did not really see any and when I have a healthy lunch I like to reward myself with a nice cookie (very counter-productive I am sure). I am excited to go back and try a few more items the next time I am in Boulder looking for a healthy meal.\n",

            "On the water and great atmosphere. The coffee is good but not great and completely overpriced when there are so many well known joints for coffee around. The one complaint I have is the wait time for your drink. They literally have a sign up trying to make a joke about how long it takes. From ordering to getting my latte it was 10 minutes with 3 people total waiting on drinks...I know you make them with plenty of love but dang!\n",
            "Enjoyed the Hibachi for a quick lunch while in town.  Chef and service was great and the food was cooked to order...no complaints.  Better than any the Hibachi restaurants here in Dayton.  Very clean which is a plus in my books!\n",
            "We have been back a couple times since I wrote my first review.  The dinner service is much better than the lunch was.  Maybe I just caught them on the wrong day.  Anyway, four stars for the dinner shift.\n",
            "Amazing food and service, beautiful restaurant. I took a star away because it is one of the noisiest restaurants I have visited at Disney. Something about the acoustics make it extremely loud. I could barely hear my date across the table. But the food was exceptional. If you are looking for a nice meal at the Boardwalk, be it a little pricey, look no further. The caprese tomato salad was the best I have ever had, hands down. I also got the canadian cheddar cheese soup, and the scalloped potatoes, which were phenomenol. My date got the sea scallops and said they were amazing. We shared the Sinful Chocolate dessert and it was stupid good. Ridiculously good. Great food! Lovely night.\n",
            "This place is tiny and intimate.  I stopped in there once, and I had a good experience.  The food was delicious - they value quality over quantity.  This was a surprise to me, because I ordered biscuits and gravy, and expected a big meal, but I got a little one - delicious, but little.\n",
            "Cute little upscale bar that has out door seating.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  Check it out!!\n",
            "Lobster roll was very good, nice toast on the roll. Fries were crisp, overall decent lunch deal. Place definitely smells like a bar and the music was bad, but I am basing this review on food and nice cold beer. They were out of my 1st choice (Yuengling - OG PA girl right here) but the glass was chilled and 2nd choice (Stella) tasted quite refreshing on a fall day.\n",
            "Dragon Village was on par with my expectations when I was craving Chinese take-out.  I arrived to pick up my order ten minutes after I called and then only waited another 5 minutes.  The food was hot and fresh!  The staff members were very pleasant.  \n",

            "I really enjoyed the Crab Rangoon the most.  The flavor of the cheese filling was so yummy.  I also ordered Orange Beef, but was a bit let down because the pieces consisted mostly of breading and hardly any meat.  The sauce, however, was spicy and delicious.  Lastly, I ordered the veggie Lo Mein, which contained plenty of veggies and had a nice flavor.  Why I ordered so many items just for one person, you may ask?  I am eating for two now, give me a flippin' break here!\n",

            "Went back to Hopdoddy's the day after my first review. On day two, I enjoyed the Continental Club, which is a turkey burger. Delicious! As usual, too much meat for me; but, there does not appear to be a kids' menu yet. All of my co-workers were pleased with their burgers - a Janis Joplin (veg for the vegetarian; and, he was impressed), a Magic Shroom (enjoyed the combination of pesto and goat cheese), a Buffalo Bill (said the bison tasted delicious), and an Ahi Tuna (we were amazed at the substantial piece of tuna). Even though Hopdoddy's was just as crowded as the day before, there was a table for the six of us waiting by the time we finished at the cash register. Very good experience.\n",

            "Went here with two of my friends from the marina, three guys looking for food and drink. Nice bar and restaurant with tasty food, convenient to the marina. A little pricey but it seems like the place to go to see and be seen, even on a Tuesday night. Ordered half the lobster pasta dish which was delicious and the perfect size, nice and rich without being overly so. Average selection of beer taps with local favorites and a few from around the region. Decent wine list. The service was good at the bar, we actually had the bartender and manager stop by several times to make sure we were okay. Somehow earned a free desert, probably colateral benefits from my friends flirting with the staff or just a nice perk. While the desert was free, you get what you pay for, sort of a tasteless combination of chocolate and cherries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, if you are looking for a place with a lot of energy close to the marina this is a good pick. If you want a quiet, inexpensive place you might go elsewhere. Food seemed hit or miss.\n",
            "I really like this place! It is open later than any cafe' in Boulder (11 pm!) So it is my late-night go-to for Yerba Mate iced tea and $1 off their awesome Panini sandwiches after 9 pm :-) I took one star off because we do not usually go for the music and poetry (we like to work on our laptops at the cafe) and the music, etc, is so loud and the cafe is so crowded that we usually cannot hang out there after 7 pm. We get our drinks to go, it is not that big of a deal. However, at the moment we are actually sitting in our car outside the cafe with our drinks to chat because there was nowhere to sit or stand inside :-) I think having such a cool community venue for local artists is worth the inconvenience to some of us, though.\n",
            "We went here kind of last minute at around 5 on a Thursday because of the good reviews here on Yelp. I can see how someone could mistake their casual friendliness for awkwardness however I personally loved it. The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating.\n",

            "I was impressed with brown bag. Great atmosphere with plenty of options. They have many different sandwiches, sides and desserts. I split the Bens black and blue sandwich and another sandwich of the week. Both were amazing. You can taste the quality of each ingredient. The sides are also not something to be overlooked. I went with a side sweet kale salad but it was hard to settle with that with all the other options available. The part I was disappointed with was the desserts. I had a red velvet cheesecake bar and it was lacking in flavor. It looked good enough but did not meet expectations. This is the same price as panera or other fast casual chains but so much better. I would return.\n",
            "The best breakfasts tacos I had the weekend I was in Austin. I also tried Taco Deli which are also very good, but I like the more authentic taste of these. MIGAS are the way to go!. Only reason the place did not get a 5th star is the wait time. It takes awhile to get your food but it was worth it in the end.\n",

It was all good but not great. The atmosphere felt very fancy and the view of the river was romantic. I would say this is more a place to go for the ambiance (a date), not great food. The staff was very polite, probably the most polite we have come across in Portland, even after we mentioned we had a Groupon. They were very professional and  knew how to do what a server should and that is sell a plate. And again very expensive. \n",

It was agreed that the best meal at our table was the bolognaise.  Although, everyone enjoyed their meals.  I would not suggest the spaghetti and meatballs.   Too plain.  Go for something big here (the price is always the price fixe, I guess) , so it is totally worth it.\n",

I will take my spaghetti with meat sauce every time over a meat ball. A meatball sub? Well, before Mighty Meatballs I had yet to find one that I really really liked. Would I eat a few of them? Of course. They were never event meals though. Nothing that I really looked forward to and they were for sustenance more than enjoyment. In the end, who eats meatballs for mere sustenance? Whatever the answer to that question may be. I enjoyed Mighty Meatball, and the reason was probably the opposite of what most people will enjoy them.\n",

Hopefully he will get the hang of it- he was polite and sweet just overwhelmed. So glad to have this gem in the neighborhood.\n",
            "Really good food , complimentary chips and salsa ( chips were warm ). The fish tacos were really good  so was the quesadillas. The house margarita was also very good . \n",
            "\n",
            "I Will definitely go back again .\n",
            "I have never been let down by the Boathouse. 4 of us came in for some tasty, tasty lobster. We all ordered the 1.25lb lobster and were delighted with the taste and service that accompanied our crustaceans. They were not cheap, around $40 per person, add a bottle of wine ($35) and a few other bevies and you have a $300 bill. (Good thing I got gift cards for Christmas!). \n",
            "We were seated next to the window with a view of the river. All very pleasant. A+\n",
            "Ambience is realy nice,  I was there in a weekday at 10am and it was packed.  So I guess not so much the kind of place you just want to chill,  coming here is more of an experience. \n",
            "\n",
            "Service was excellent.  I had the poached egg with salmon for breakfast,  which was good,  but not outstanding.  It sure makes you crave for more. \n",
            "\n",
            "The waffles on the other hand took me by surprise.  I thought it s realy delicious.  I ordered it without any toppings to fully enjoy its original flavour along with the coffee.\n",
            "Never had a bad experience at the Clay Pit. My only comment would be that their spiciness of their food is never the same twice. Sometimes you can get it mild in spice and it comes out way to spicy and sometimes you get it just right. All in all though, their food is fantastic!\n",
            "I love this place! I would say they have some of the best burgers I have ever had! The drinks and service rocked! I will absolutely keep going here! Now to make it a 5 star they need a dance floor :-)\n",
            "My wife and daughters love this place as much as I do.  Boneless wings are our favorite, but so is the honey BBQ chicken salad.  It is very noisy so you cannot have team meetings here.  It is a favorite place to go and watch your favorite games.\n",
            "Although I paid a visit to Java Cats just earlier today, I already know I will be back soon! Spending time with cuddly felines does a person good. =^._.^= \n",
            "\n",
            "The cafe itself gives off a very cozy and welcoming vibe, and it sort of doubles as a waiting area for people with pre-existing appointments. You get to observe the cats through the glass that separates the playroom from the cafe. \n",
            "\n",
            "As part of the reservation, you get a complimentary drink (e.g. coffee, tea) of your choice. I got a regular plain iced coffee which I thought was delicious :)\n",
            "\n",
            "The cats were adorable and quite various in their personalities! I personally thought that they were friendly but were more interested in doing their own thing. There are also plenty of cat toys, scratch posts, and shelves that will keep the felines entertained. Some cats were very playful with the toys but others seemed to be like \"...what do I do with this thing, hooman?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Most of the cats were sleeping when I stepped in at 1 PM, but they slowly woke up and began warming up to the people in the room. However, they seemed to be quite tuckered out by the end of the hour as I saw most of them retreating to take a nap. I am curious as to how they are like at different hours of the day. \n",
            "\n",
            "Like many others, I echo the sentiment that parking can be difficult to find especially during the lunch rush hour. I am definitely snagging an appointment earlier during the day the next time I come here!\n",
            "Carrot Cake + carrot purée = AWESOME\n",
            "\n",
            "My friends and I came here during Dine Out 2014. Their carrot cake was my absolute favourite dish of the evening - I had no idea carrot purée could taste so good!\n",
            "\n",
            "I loved the hipster decor and atmosphere and I have heard good things about their brunch - will definitely come back for that!\n",
            "I stayed at the hotel, Pinnacle Harbourfront, and visited this little bistro for happy hour. \n",
            "\n",
            "Got here around 5pm before heading up to my room and it was quiet and empty-ish. The servers were all super friendly. Was here on Thursday? and had a super friendly waiter-forgot his name.\n",
            "\n",
            "My boyfriend and I was there for the Happy Hour. Got the nachos, chicken wings, a few beers and few cocktails.\n",
            "\n",
            "Great place for a simple pre-dinner eat and drinks. Excellent service as well.\n",
            "Came here around 3am for a late night meal. All of the service was really quick! We had a group of 5 and were seated in 5 minutes. We quickly ordered and received our food about 10 minutes later despite how busy they were. I had the scallion pancakes with roast beef which were delicious and the mini juicy buns with pork!\n",
            "\n",
            "A couple of my friends did receive the wrong food, or were told it was there is when it was not; However, at that point none of us cared! It was still delicious and I highly recommend as a late night eatery.\n",
            "Food is decent, if there is ever a line it moves quickly. I am not a fan of seeing the cooks drinking out of cans and keeping the can on a prep table. If anything runs out it is replaced in minutes.\n",
            "Great fish tacos! Good food, drinks, and atmosphere. On the second floor there are pool tables and other games to play. It was pretty relaxed during the day and a good place to come hangout and get a drink. They have good specials like wings ,etc. Staff was very helpful and very attentive. First time to Vancouver and will definitely be back.\n",
            "Nice atmosphere, beautiful view of the marina and their caramel cake is a must try. So delicious!\n",
            "Thought this place was great.  I must admit I ate very little but what I tasted was delicious.  I had the calamari, great taste, fluffy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The peach sangria was tastey and we ordered 3 pitchers , or was it 4?  The bummer was the pitchers came with lots of ice, and they did not refill our glasses with the fruit.  That should change.\n",
            "\n",
            "There was  Latin music band last night , and they played 3 or 4 sets.  Great space for dancing !  Had I known they had a band every Friday night, I would have gone sooner!\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I do have 2 critiques.\n",
            "\n",
            "One , we starts our night close to the door , then the music started, and when we started dancing we saw lots of open tables close to the band.  We asked to move tables and a waiter become a bit combative.  I remained calm and said, we just want to be close to the music, how can we make this right and make everyone happy?  He said I had to talk to a manager.  No problem.  Manager came over and helped us right out, we just had to close our tab there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now I was having so much fun that I would not let anything bother us, but I believe the same waiter served us at new table.  He messed up an order.  He slammed the pitcher of sangria down on the table.  Never offered to pour for anyone.  No table side manner.  No problem ... Last night, nothing was going to stop me from having a good time...\n",
            "Great tasting tacos for Vancouver standards! There are not a lot of authentic Mexican restaurants in Vancouver, but this place serves some tacos that reminded me of the food in Tijuana, Mexico. \n",
            "\n",
            "The service is friendly and the ingredients for their tacos are high quality and fresh. I tried most of their tacos and they were all very delicious. Prices are on the expensive side for the size of their tacos, but one has to remember that you are still in Vancouver.\n",
            "Not my favorite Burritos in the world, but everything else makes up for it. Great service and I love the Coke machine that let us you mix and match your favorite flavors (Cherry & Vanilla Diet Coke / Coke Zero!).\n",
            "\n",
            "Only complaints are that there could be a little more kick to cajun style and there cane be waits due to the fact that you are on a college campus.\n",
            "What a great experience. Finding places in town that really hit the foodie nerve for lunch as well as they do dinner can be a challenge sometimes.  Some of the best choices on my to-do list are not even open for lunch, while others have an almost pedestrian menu selection in comparison for dinner.  Not true with Seven Lamps.\n",
            "\n",
            "My friend Meaghan and I have similar foodie tendencies - make it delicious, and wow us without getting all frou frou.  Impress us.  The menu was an example of how to confound two food lovers - so many choices.  We decided to rip off the Band-Aid and just pick what leapt out first.\n",
            "\n",
            "Small plates:  I went with the Warm Asparagus Soup - it came with a quenelle of crème fraîche and fines herbs. It was smooth, creamy and simply delectable. It had that creamy mouth feel without tasting like it was packed with heavy cream. The crème fraîche slowly melted into the soup as I ate and it made it all the more rich and delicious. The perfect choice for me.  Meags went for the Smoked Ruby Beets, golden beets and candy striped beets - this was served with watermelon radish slices, chèvre and pecans (which seemed to be candied). The plate came out and looked like a work of art. She raved about the beets - due to the pecans I could not taste this one myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Entrées: Meags chose the Idaho Potato Gnocchi.  It came served with roasted mushrooms, white truffle and parsley on top.  Plus, there was some kind of butter crouton accompanying it.  This I could try and O...M...G! Earthly, rich, and soft pillows of potato-y goodness - I would eat this daily if given the chance. Until I got to my dish - I selected the Porcini mushroom stuffed torteloni with celery and brillat savarin cheese sauce. This was also earthy and rich and completely scrumptious.  There are not really enough words to describe how yummy this pasta was - just wowza.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here is what was so great - they had lunch portion size options for less money on the menu.  The small plates were just right for lunch apps and I left without feeling like I was going to die from being over-stuffed - even after eating pasta. Funny enough, we both ended up going all vegetarian without meaning to, but it was satisfying. And man, I cannot wait to go back.\n",
            "\n",
            "Did I mention they serve Dancing Goats coffee?  Bonus Points for Seven Lamps.\n",
            "I liked it a lot - not as much as the frau, but a lot.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, first the interesting kind of serendipitous part first: there we are, minding our business - me sucking down Pilsner something or other and she (happily) some British cider.  A commotion catches my eye - lots of activity, sounds, and dust kicking up in the corner.  Yes, we had stumbled upon one of the legs of the Bianca/Vanessa victory lap/return party.  It was amusing to see...\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, good drinks, okay food (I will get there), and a neat locale.  I will not wax poetic about the wood and lighting (the rock crystal lamps ARE cool) except to point out the gargoyles that are carved over the bar.  Did anyone else see that?  Pretty cool.\n",
            "\n",
            "My lovely companion got the shrimp - she liked  them.\n",
            "I got the anchovy thing - it was good; tasted as anchovies should.  If you read the thread of what people do not like to eat you will understand my grossoutedness of the eggplant fritters.\n",
            "I did try them and re-confirmed the vile, evil nature of eggplant.\n",
            "\n",
            "Parking really bites; I guess there is not much to be done there, right?\n",
            "Had a really outstanding New Year's Eve dinner here.  Elegant atmosphere with the waitstaff all glammed up (Bond theme?). Food was delicious and well-priced. Service was excellent. A lovely space and a memorable meal.\n",
            "The park exceeded my expectations, but the food sucks!The shows and exhibits were awesome! We did not bother buying the tickets for the amusement park. We come from close to cedar point the roller coaster capital of the world that makes SeaWorld coasters look lame. My only complaint was the food, I hated it! We bought the meal plan, but the food was really bad that I did not want to eat a second time making the plan not worth it. There were also very few food selections. SeaWorld needs to improve there food. However, the drink package was the way too go!\n",
            "I like Thai food and this is my favorite place in the area. The prices are great, the food is great, they have exceptional pad Thai. The only other Thai place that i have been in the Boston area that compares is the King and I on Charles street down-town, but the Tamarind house is much easier to park at! I have never eaten there, only take out, so I do not even know if they have a liquor license, but i really love the food. I got a stuffed shrimp dish that was incredible, and left me wondering before i picked it up, and after i had eaten it, how the hell do you stuff a shrimp? Check it out!\n",
            "Classic local diner kind of place. Coffee are not Peet's but above average trick stop blend. \n",
            "The pancakes rock. The huevos is my favorite. The breakfast burrito is above average and large. \n",
            "Main thing here is the service. Fast. Pleasant. Love it. \n",
            "Oh, and it is a clean joint too.\n",
            "I have been there twice... I was very impressed by their bibimbap, but was not impressed by their sushi.  I asked the waitress what typically goes into the bibimbap (so many choices on the paper) she pointed them out, and that was pretty much what I got, it was awesome... I thought the hot stone bowl was pretty cool, but not sure if its worth $3, will be trying bibimbap in regular bowl next time... also looking forward to trying some of their entrees, saw a one that looked delicious on a table near me... Sushi was okay and a large portion, but I was expecting a little higher quality for the price...\n",
            "\n",
            "Staff was very friendly, I liked the inside, though if they want to attract more customers, I would advise them to dim the lights inside down some during the evening hours and get some lights for their little patio....\n",
            "I went here to watch the world cup with my Dad on father's day. I was pleasantly surprised. I expected a total pub atmosphere but it is more like a cross between pub/bar and restaurant. They have a great little patio area if you want to be in the heart of gastown soaking the summer sun, and the space inside is huge, with tons of t.v. screens.\n",
            "I expected pretty mediocre food given it is a bar, but again was pleasantly surprised. They had delicious healthy salads and sandwiches, along with your typical pub classics. The service was good, the food came quickly, and we won the game :)\n",
            "Awesome place. From the outside you would never never think how big it actually is. Loved the modern decor. Chicken soup Dumplings were good. The fried beef dumpling was to bland for me. But the Pork with Hoi Sin Sauce + pancakes! Wow!!!! I could of just had this alone!!! The pork was so tender and the Hoi sin was sweet n salty. Nice touch. Yumm!!! We also ordered chicken with chestnuts bone out. And asked for it to be a lil spicy. flavor was perfect! Service was great and quick. The hostess was extremely friendly and recommended the pork dish! It is a must try. Will return when back in Vancouver.\n",
            "AN ABSOLUTELY MUST DO! THE SOUP THE SOUP THE SOUP! I have eaten here several times & tried a wide variety of items. I would say the food is pretty good. But the soup is in a whole different spectrum. AUTHENTIC HOME MADE ITALIAN CHICKEN SOUP THAT TASTES LIKE SOMEONE IS GRANDMA MADE IT. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUSSSSSS!  10 STARS FOR THE SOUP. It comes with Free Bread that is great too. Every time I come here we always Get the Chicken Soup, The Bread & Cappuccinos. The restaurant is located in the heart of The North End Boston on Salem St.  \n",

            "I do not think I have ever seen mussels so happily bathed in white wine sauce. The bonus is that your baguette basket is refilled so you will not look silly finishing the sauce with your spoon.\n",
            "\n",
            "The service is always friendly and attentive. A stellar wine list where your server cannot suggest a wrong pairing. Our water glass was always filled and we were not cloyingly asked how we were doing throughout the evening.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oh.....and their creme brulee is silky and velvety.....sinfully good\n",
            "I went here with a small group the other night.  Luckily we called ahead because it was packed.  Since we had a group we decided to order a little extra to try some stuff.  The soup of the day was Potato, Leek and Clam, it was delicious.  We also got Calamari which was perfectly cooked but it did not come with a dipping sauce, so be prepared to offend the chef if you do order a side of sauce because he would rather you eat it the way he serves it (I appreciate his demand really).  We also got the Fried Cheese Bread which was ok but probably will not get it again, its kind of a novelty item in my mind and I really preferred the herbed bread that they serve with our meal.  The beef carpaccio was freaking awesome, it reminded me of one that my wife and I love to order in San Francisco.  After that the entrees came out, I had ordered the Lamb Stew served over soft polenta, it was beautifully cooked and the flavors were right on.  My wife got the Ravioli stuffed with ricotta and mushroom which we were told they make the pasta for them in house.  The Carbonara and Vegetable Capellini were also ordered and were fantastic as well.  We thought about desert but were too full to go down that path.  Over all the meal was great and the service was a bit slow but we were not in a hurry.\n",
            "I went there couple weeks ago, I order dish but they give wrong one, but you change for me . Food it is ok.\n",
            "Better than I expected it to be.  To be fair, I am not a Boulder fan so that alone kind of ruins most dining experiences.  But this place was delicious and it feels a lot fancier than it is.  Service was a little slow, but it was also super busy so I cannot 100% hold that against them.\n",
            "We ordered several of our lunches there.  The food is pretty tasty and plentiful.  Prices are high but on par for the other resort restaurants.  We ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich a few times - yum!  Their side salads were fresh and flavorful.  The waitstaff is efficient and  friendly.  I recommend to anyone staying at the hotel longer than  a few days as they have many options available.\n",
            "So I am writing their review based on the shaved ice I had there yesterday. (I have never had their mac and cheese.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the food carts were forced across the street into a smaller area, it has affected the abilities of some of the food carts. The shaved ice comes in one size only now, ($4), and you can choose up to 3 different flavorings for your shaved ice. I picked: strawberry, lychee, and passion fruit, great combination! Not only was the flavoring spot on, but the lychee syrup was some of the best I have ever had before!\n",
            "\n",
            "One star taken away because they no longer offer their shaved ice with the ice cream inside, only the sweet cream on top. I know these are first world problems, but when it comes to shaved ice, that really makes the difference between 4 stars and 5 stars.\n",
            "Holy crack food! \n",
            "\n",
            "I was pretty surprised to see all the low reviews for this place and admittedly, it is pretty pricey. But man, these guys showed us a great time. Unfortunately it was raining the night we attended, but the farmhouse was super cozy and service impeccable. \n",
            "\n",
            "We started off the evening with a free cocktail...pretty yummy and FREE! \n",
            "\n",
            "Then we went through a 6 course meal that was crack-tastic! Seriously, for several of the dishes we took a bite and eyeballs were rolling back in ecstasy. So freaking good. Only thing that was subpar was the desert but whatevs. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now, back to the price. I am Canadian and the exchange rate sucks right now...so with tax and tip it cost me $120. That is crazy steep. BUT it was 6 courses. \n",

            "I have not been to a Japanese steak house since I lived near charleston, sc. \n",
            "This place was awesome! We came in around dinner time on a Friday night. We were welcomed& seated (with a high chair.) right away. The waitress interacted with my 17 month old, while my husband & I looked over the menu. She was very nice and quite helpful for us. Food was pretty good, in our vegetables we got bean sprouts( not used to getting those with japanese food) I was surprised with the \" white sauce\" I am used to having.... It was very was very wasabi-ish flavored. I did not ask if they have mayonaise based sauce though. The rest of the food was good. The cook was very nice with considering the children's age around the table ( the couple next to us had a daughter that was around 5, She was scared of the fire.) My sons first reaction to a little fire was scared as well. But it was nice that the cook was cool about it. I got steak and shrimp; fried rice; and veggies. My son got chicken and white rice& my husband got chicken; fried rice and veggies. We all left happy. It was a great experience. We will defiantly go again!\n",
            "How have they done this? Great people serving fresh, well prepared, delicious but simple food. If I had a complaint it would be that the veggie portions are a wee tad small, their system for hosting/seating guests can cause a backup at the door and sometimes your server can take a while to come back so you can get the check. I eat paleo about 80/20 and there is plenty here for me. I hit this place a few times a month and it is a go to. This place is what you get when such a business understands that products can be simple. Find, and train well, great people who care about guests and provide a consistent product. I love their original beverages too. \n",
            "We need F&B to provide more healthy  beverage options than Liquor, Traditional Tea and Soft Drinks and you guys seem just the place to do it. Consider mixed teas and juices! (just sayin. Love ya, mean it) Fingers crossed!\n",
            "Nice restaurant and very good for Harvard vicinity.  I would have enjoyed more of a spring focus on the menu.  Food is well-prepared and wine list is adequate.  Service was outstanding as they are able to finish in plenty of time for nearby theater.  However, significantly better restaurants in other areas of Cambridge.  Lower rents seem to lead to better restaurants.\n",
            "Disappointed with our dinner. The main entrees were good as were the samosas and naan but the Aloo Gobi was a mush warmed over and the server was surly and inattentive.  So I gave it a 4 star rating for food mostly being good but if you spend $100 -you do not want a surly server and warmed over veggies.\n",
            "If you are ever in East Vancouver with pizza on your mind, Twilight Pizza is your go to place! The T-Rex pizza was top notch. Service was better than expected, and we got right in on a Friday night! We had a wonderful experience that will bring us back again.\n",
            "Good place for a fast, hearty Chicago-inspired sandwich.  The gyros here are very good: flavorful meat with fresh veg and tzatziki sauce.  Feta is extra.  My favorite gyro here is the Feta-Fire: a gyro with the meat and veg tossed in very spicy feta spread.  All are served on nicely grilled pita bread.  Also good is the Italian Beef sandwich: sliced roast beef with Giardenara relish on top, on a hoagie bun.  Thank you, Loops, for serving the juice on the side.  Some other places dump it on the sandwich, turning the bun into a soggy mess.  I like to be able to administer the juice on an as-needed basis.  They also have Chicago style hot dogs, which I have not yet sampled.  I am not a huge fan of their fries, which are very greasy and salty, but some people seem to absolutely love them, so it seems to be a matter of personal preference.  Look for their coupons in the local mailers.  There is usually a good one every month that will save you a couple of bucks if you are getting more than one sandwich.  I like this place for carry out.  It is minutes from my home and they crank out your order in about ten minutes.  I have always found the staff to be friendly and attentive.\n",
            "This is for the Indians in the boston area who have not discovered an Indian grocery store yet! I am such a fob and love this place actually has mangoes....yummmy. I went there with my mom and saw some stuff, that i had long forgotten, like Vicco Vargidanti and Fair and Lovely, and all kinds of 'indian vegetables.real tinda!!. If you can brave the clasutophobia, if you are true indian i am sure you can!! this place has it all.\n",

            "Also has a great bar with very nice and attentive bar tenders.\n",
            "I have to say I was a bit hesitant with the reviews but it was really tasty.  We had the lamb burger, mushroom Swiss burger, and the breakfast burger all were good.  The patio was really nice and we had wonderful service Sara was fantastic! We will be back.\n",

            "Entree: I had the blackened mahi mahi and mussels.  The fish was a bit spicy....just enough for me though.  Portions were good size.  The mussels were my favorite of the night.

It was incredible....I am kicking myself for not remembering the name.  He also had the same rita and then a fire in the hole.  This is a MUST here! its like a mini titos vodka rita in a shot glass with a spicy rimmed jalapeno served practically whole inside...with a chaser full bottle of lone star.  \n",

As a frequent lunchtime customer, I have seen a lot of vendors underestimate the foot traffic at this venue (though it seems they may have been given some bad information at the start).  By now they have done this enough times to have a better handle on traffic volumes here - there are a LOT of people working in this building, with hundreds more moving in this year!\n",

Inspired specifically by their FALAFEL, which is easily the best I have had in years.  There are a lot of Middle East / Mediterranean style vendors that setup here on other days, and Chik Chak's felafel is better than all of them.

            "Paella - I ordered this and it was delicious. I normally prefer to have my egg cooked over hard, but I enjoyed what looked like to be an over easy egg because the runny yolk really brought this dish together. Similar to how red chili pepper paste (gochujang)  in bibimbap brings life to the dish by not making it dry. So I just naturally mixed the whole paella dish like you do with bibimbap, hah. I thought it worked well like that. I think some gochujang  in it would not have been so bad either. Ah, the Korean in me :P\n",

The homemade sausage was great - just wish there was more sausage and less polenta cake; the polenta was good, just wanted more sausage. The open ravioli was really good. My wife's bombolotti was very warm and hearty, yet not a dense dish. Would have had 5-stars if they had coffee and more dessert selection. Ours was free (tiramiso) because I checked in w Yelp but I would gladly have paid for another with coffee/espresso.\n",

Mine came with a small side salad of cucumbers and tomatoes in balsamic that complimented the sandwich nicely, and overall the flavor was great.  We saw another table get an order of onion rings that looked delicious so we ordered a half order - those I would say are worth skipping, nothing very special.  Overall, the food was pretty good.\n",

The Oxley Spritz was fantastic, nice subtle cucumber notes, and not overpowering the less Gin-y flavor of the Oxley.  The Watermelon Margarita was not nearly as good, being more tart than I would have liked.  The Swift Water had a nice lemonade-y sweetness to it without being overpowering, and seemed like the kind of drink you could get in fun trouble with.\n",

The gyro was okay, when I go again I will get the shish kabob meat combo, because it was much more flavorful. I think I could honestly eat a dozen of the spanakopita, and the come with a nice little salad with yummy salty feta. \n",

We also ordered the seafood risotto and the grilled pork belly. The seafood risotto was good but the grilled pork belly was a wow. The meat was flavorful and tender. The white chocolate sauce paired very nicely with it. I actually used some of the left over bread to wipe the plate clean. \n",

My friend got the veggie tacos and margaritas. She did not think they were very strong. Nice laid back atmosphere and the music was really good. It had a nice Spanish vibe. Will be back.\n",

I expected more people to be there to watch the big game, but I guess the recent cold weather was a deterent. Great atmosphere with attentive service. If I had to pick on anything, the TV' reception by our table was'nt the best quality for a HD monitor. Three pitchers and a solid french dip later, everything was looking good! I will be coming back to the Clubhouse soon. I also noticed a promotion for 20% off with a Magic ticket on gameday-Bonus!\n",
            "I went here for the first time on Wednesday night.  I have heard so much about the food and how great it is.  It is really good, but being a member of a Cuban family, I am spoiled by my mother-in-law's and husband's cooking.  Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  \n",

            "This location has a lot of natural light and the decor was efficient. The assembly line style ensures you will never be in a long line. The kebap reminds me of a gryo but I preferred this bread delivery method than most pitas. Doner kebap literally means \"rotating kebap\" so though it is hella hot I loved being able to be a part of watching their spit meats roast and be sliced.  I enjoyed the spicy tender mix of lamb and beef, an all lamb blend can be overwhelmingly gamy and this was a great compromise. The house sauce is a bit like a tzatziki, the garlic is house + garlic, and the spicy red is the house + cayenne pepper. The veggies were all fresh and I was delighted with the nod to Texas varieties available like corn and jalapeno. I really wish they offered a side that they actually cooked in house though. It could be just me, but I really craved french fries with the kebap. \n",

A lot of food for the price, the service is very friendly, quick, helpful, and great.  And a nice selection of desert options for vegans and non.  Proper Eats is a great place, I recommend!!!\n",

            "This a cool, modern burger spot with great food and innovative ideas. I sat at the bar and watched all the various burgers being made and delivered and they were pretty amazing as far as burgers go. I had the shrimp burger (because I love shrimp) and it was good (very light and shrimpy) but I really want to go back and try a hamburger next time I am in Atlanta. The vibe was cool and young and fresh and the cocktails were good too.\n",

We ordered a Cuban sandwich, 2 ropa viejas, fried yuca, a mamey smoothie, and a guava smoothie.  I am pretty sure they got my sandwich order wrong because I said no pickles and it had pickles!  it also had pork in it, which I think is an extra that you can add, but I definitely did not ask for that.  They also forgot to give us utensils after they gave us all of our food.  Nonetheless, the sandwich was good.  The bread could have been better, but I do not think you can get this stuff anywhere else in Boston!  The ropa vieja was simply delicious!  It comes with yellow rice or rice with beans (pick the yellow rice)!  The stringy beef is tender and the sauce has so much flavor.  The fried yuca was pretty good, but the dipping sauce was a little plain, I actually had to add some more vinegar.  The smoothies were good too, but I can say that the mamey is better than the guava for sure.  All of this came out to be a little over $40 and was more than enough to fill 3 people, so it was not bad at all.  This place is definitely a must try...\n",

I am going to take exception to those that compare it to Hooters, they are wrong.  Yes wrong! I wonder if they have ever even been to Hooters.  And to make statement that a clue to a place being poor in quality is related to how the staff dresses is meaningless. If a place has poor quality it is a management problem not a wait staff problem.  Enough said.\n",

This attire is what you see girls wearing today at malls and at the lakes nothing out of the normal for summer outfits girls wear especially in Austin and even Hawaii. The outfits at Hooters, Bone Daddies, Twin Peaks, and Tilted Kilt are more reveling then the ones they wear here.  Yes the girl staff flirts with the customers, yes it is to increase tips. Most of us guys know that but we like it anyway. It works, so what!\n",

Husband ordered the blueberry pancakes with side sausage and I went with the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel (note:  they only have plain bagels).  The blueberry pancakes were enormous!  Enormous, delicious, and fresh.  My BEC was good, not punch you in the face good, but it was just a classic BEC.  It was not greasy at all either which made my belly happy.  The sausage was not anything more than regular sausage links and though the home fries looked like they would be delicious, they just tasted like potatoes.

Very refreshing, especially with the tortilla chips and salsa. Next time I really want to try a desert. Hubby got the salad bar and was very pleased. I think his favorite was the mini corn or mini gingerbread muffins. I might have had one of those too... Just so delish! I do not know if I would be back often, both locations are very out of the way for me, and since I do not eat meat my options are pretty limited. Good stuff though!\n",

            "Peet's Coffee & Tea is a chain.  The question is on how does the customers feel when attending to a chain of coffee places.  This place is relaxing.  It is near Powell's.  If the City of Books is too much then this single link of a chain of coffee places that is not the one from Starbucks is a balm to the mind.  The mochas are good.  There are comfortable seats.  One can sit down and relax.  There are scones.  One sits down with a large mocha in hand and relax. \n",

I have not walked in to Nanami and seem the place overrun, but again, we usually go late. The restaurant itself is very inviting and great place to chat with the fountain behind you quietly drowning out the rest of the restaurant's regular noise. \n",

We had a chance to chat with some of the waitresses- all of whom were very colorful and very friendly.

I am very picky about my pancakes, but this was perfect; slightly \"done\" around the edges, soft in the middle. I only wish they would have had \"real\" syrup, or at least warm syrup- I was given a plastic container of Smucker's. The egg and cheese sandwich, which I ordered on rye, was tasty, but not unlike something I could have prepared for myself at home. My husband had corned beef hash, and he said it was great. My dad got some bone-in ham steak combo thing. I do not like ham, but he said it was amazing. \n",

Food was very good : crispy piparras, crispy quail, lamb albondigas, squid tacos, octopus carpaccio, hake con choclo, and tempura fried brownies. Eric our server was excellent.\n",

Who would have thought that such a charming little pub could be hidden back behind the Drunken Unicorn? Warm wooden fixtures, rows and rows of books, and awesome lamps (mentioned elsewhere amongst these reviews) abound. It looks much nicer than it should, and I love that.\n",

Get to this place before it gets any more overfilled.\n",

If you are in the neighborhood and need some quick food and a pint, you will not be disapponited unless you are a culinary snob. (I kind of am, but you set expectations based on where you are).  Fact of the matter is, you will see some dude's watching the game, reading a book over a pint,a nd a gaggle of fiddlers practicing thier tunes on any given night.  It is a fun spot for a change of pace if that is whjat you are lookin for.\n",

            "I love this place! It has a good parking structure behind the theater, and they do validate parking as you leave. It has a lot of choices on the menu, and the food is pretty good, but the prices are pretty high for what you get. The new set up with the seats is AWESOME. They slightly recline, with individual tables. I wish there was a way to turn off the light that is on below the table, it can get a little distracting while you are watching the movie. Overall I really liked this location, there is lots to do before or after a movie. Get a bite or drink at one of the locations in the area. For those with kids, the thinkery is within walking distance. There Is also a very different style playground. They have really changed that area from what it used to be.\n",
            "Bryce Gillmore is one of the city's top talents, and this is one of the city's best restaurants.I happen to think he excels with rich animal proteins and seafood (the snacks and lighter fare that focuses on produce can be a bit underwhelming). His expertly-judged use of acid never fails to impress me.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also recommend ordering off the menu a la carte (4-5 dishes per person) rather than splurging on the tasting menu (which is more likely to be an up-and-down affair with unsatisfying bite-sized portions) because that approach allows you to play to target the kitchen's strengths. Bryce is not afraid to challenge his patrons with dishes like chewy pig skin \"noodles\" in hot sauce. Surely delightful to some, but unquestionably not to everyone is taste.\n",

I tried the ribs, coleslaw and baked beans. I even made room for their brownie sundae dessert which is also delicious. I would certainly recommend this place. FYI there is a cover charge of five dollars which I was not aware of prior  to going, but other than that the experience was amazing and the food was great!\n",

However, when we arrived, we had reservations, and our table had been given away.  We had to wait for about 20 mins for another table to open up.  The place was packed (because the pats and the red sox were playing that night) but we got seating near the back of the downstairs part.  It was nice and cozy and we were served quickly (food and drink).  The drinks were expensive (especially the shots) and we also got pizza and nachos (which were exquisite by the way).  It was a fun place to be, but after the red sox game let out, it was so packed I had to wait in line for the bathroom for about 15 mins!\n",

Gave me inspiration to make a banana bread freanch toast when I get home. Yum!  Anyway, I had the spinach portabella artichoke omelette without the spinach. It was great. I ordered egg whites, but they forgot and used whole eggs. They apologized, but did not offer any compensation, which I found odd, but will not hold against them.

            "The burger was pretty good. Not the best I have had, but definitely not the worst. I am a little sensitive to more standard cheeses, enough so that, when coupled with a greasy burger, they can make me fairly sick. The havarti contrasted well and the bacon was perfectly crispy. No post-eating nausea. There were small bits of the patty that were slightly red but nothing to worry about. \n",
            "\n",

Staples for me here are the Sandwich Cubano and the tostones which I cover in the delicious mojo sauce which is probably not great for me, but eff it, I am already eating a giant sandwich and fried fruit so lay off me.\n",

Their tables are all pretty close together and clustered in one part of the room. The atmosphere is nice though, and includes free wi-fi, and on nice days there are a handful of seats outside. With its convenient location on North Highland I stop in here more often than any other coffee shop, I would say. They have an enormous array of coffees to choose from, including 4 different featured coffees of the day, which  are rated by the staff and described by flavor/style, which helps me (a somewhat coffee neophyte) pick what I want.\n",

I will say the presentation is a little messier and the chicken is a little sweeter and fattier (ie. sometimes chicken skin is attached) than Dowee's, which I loved, but the flavor of chicken and rice is there and everything is still delicious.

She is a chicken only eater so it was a little more difficult for her to find an entree on the menu.  I could have been satisfied ordering any entree as they all looked appealing.  I had the foie gras appetizer, suckling pig entree, Gruyere biscuits and a Brooklyn lager.  I highly recommend all of those.  The Gruyere biscuits were a little on the greasy side even for a biscuit, but had delicious flavor.  The foie gras was seared perfectly.  The desserts looked interesting as we saw them going to other tables, but the descriptions and titles made them seem bland.  We skipped dessert and went out for ice cream afterward.\n",

I mean the \"gastropub\" concept is cool and new to Orlando, but The Ravenous Pig seems a little too \"inspired\" by The Spotted Pig (http://www.thespottedpig.com/) in NYC.  Nonetheless, very good food and great draft beers so I cannot complain.\n",

It was so delicious we dropped our previous dining plans and grabbed a seat outside. It was a Thursday afternoon and they have weekday lunch specials for $10.95 which includes baklava. We have since been back several times and our favorite dishes are the Lavas with hummus and babaganoush although the prices are steep for the portions they give you. The white bean salad is really good and a plentiful portion. I usually opt for the chicken adana and my husband gets the lamb. The chicken patties are also really good. Wish they had other side options other than carrots, onions, and pickled beets. The mimosas are 2 for 1 on weekends but with a steep price tag. Ask before you order unless you want to be shocked when the bill comes. \n",

When I saw the foccacia I totally ripped a piece and dipped it into the stew, instead of the hummus and what a good choice. The hummus was great too, but it is all about the tomato goodness. Atop of this bright red dish was two perfectly poached white eggs. MMMMmm. MY fav. Suprisingly the sausage tasted a bit off to me. It tasted like chinese sausage, I was not too big on this. \n",

Has a great selection of meats, veggies and sauces and you put together bowls by yourself.  Its pretty cool to watch your meal cook right in front of you.  The end result is very flavorful; I personally like making mine with lots of beef, noodles, carrots, and spicy teriyaki sauce!  Also, the ice cream at the end of the meal is a nice touch.

The shakes are yummy, the Hagen daas ice cream makes a difference.\n",

It gives the soup a earthier heartier texture. The Green Curry looks nothing like the picture but taste better than it looks. Again large cut veggies and so much more to the dish than stick cut (julienne cut) in these two dishes. A nice touch is Blue Basil has soy sauce on the table,unlike most Thai restaurants. I like a splash of soy in my curry. I am looking forward to going back to try more Blue Thai.\n",

It was delicious, but it left me wanting more.  The next time I ordered it, I decided to upsize and ordered a bowl.  The bowl was bigger than my head!  Needless to say, what I had expected to be an appetizer-sized portion ended up being my entre, leaving my half order of Mac & Cheese w/ Bacon in a doggie bag to take home.

            "- Queso Frito con Miel (4 orders): One of my favorite dishes (no matter what restaurant I have it at). Each order comes with 4 balls of fried goat cheese on a bed of caramelized onions and all drizzled in honey. Beautiful combination of sweet and savory. I think it could compete with Ecco's goat cheese balls.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Chuletas de Borrego (2 orders): The medium rare lamb chops were fall off the bone perfect. Well-seasoned and tender. Maybe I just prefer land meat compared to seafood, but this was probably my favorite meat dish at the table.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Calamares Fritos (2 orders): Holy. This is one of their signature dishes for a reason. Perfectly crispy calamari that does not feel like it is drowned in oil. There is a side of pico de gallo to add some freshness to each bite.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Pulpo Salteado (2 orders): You can order this spicy or non-spicy. The spice level for the \"spicy\" is perfect. My mouth did not burn off, but my mouth was not bored. The combination of tender octopus and soft potatoes is wonderful~ Not a lot of people at our table were fans of octopus, so I got to eat almost an entire order.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Estofado de col Rizada (1 order): Kale, manchego cheese, white beans, and potato crisps. Those are the ingredients that really stand out in this dish. The manchego cheese pair really well with the braised kale, and the potato crisps add a nice texture to the dish. This was probably my favorite vegetable dish at the table.\n",

            "- Empanada de Pollo (6 orders): We did not need this much, but they gave us 3 the first round and gave us another 3 when we requested more. It was a pretty standard empanada. Each one can be cut into 3 small pieces. Nothing too special or mind-blowing, but I love pockets of carbs filled with meat and cheese.\n",

            "- Paella Negra (for 2+): Keep in mind that paellas takes a while to cook, so make sure to order it right away. You can enjoy other tapas in the meantime. This is a good larger dish to share with the table. The black squid ink paella had an array of seafood, including salmon, shrimp, and mussels. In terms of taste, it was good, but not amazing. Nothing can compare to the paella in Spain I guess... I still recommend it if you want a larger dish to share.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Hummus de Pimiento Rojo (2 orders): Pretty standard hummus with a side of veggies and pita bread. The servers brought us more pita bread free of charge. If you get the hummus, I would also recommend getting the Aceitunas y Almendras (olives and almonds). They pair really nicely with the pita and hummus.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Ejotes Fritos (2 orders): Who knew fried green beans could be so good? I thought these were greasier than the calamari, but they were still surprisingly tasty. I think they would be great with some beer, as many fried things do...\n",
            "\n",

I could easily devour 2 plates by myself even if I am not hungry. The rest of the dishes were decent. The portions here are small and the wait for us was long (1.5 hrs for our table). Good thing it was my second dinner that night so I did not mind. I also did not realize it was a Mexican themed restaurant (my bad), which naturally contains many dishes w/corn I cannot really have. Overall a mixed experience but I had a wonderful night anyway.\n",

I probably (definitely) love them. If donuts were a sports team, I would have a personalized jersey and wear it religiously, even in the off season. Donuts are all that is right in this world.

It has this perfect dough acting as base and so much lemony goodness sealing the deal. It is a sweetness that is been tamed so as to strike a beautiful balance, not saccharine like a lot of good donuts gone bad.

I had the vegetable biryani, which I found to be unexpectedly spicy but not intolerably so, and we shared a large and tasty peshawari naan.\n",

Ambiance is generally pretty nice, no qualms with the service. Food ranges from good to very good-- cannot say I have had anything I have hated or anything I really loved, but there is always something interesting on the menu.

The only caveat is I rarely see space at the bar which means I am probably sitting for dinner if I go there, and the food is not amazing enough to lure me back all that often. It could just be the times I try to go tend to be busier, but I would not really visit Green Street with the expectations of having a few drinks  and apps at the bar.\n",

            "Decided to try something new for lunch since it is close to the office. They have a wide variety of menu items. I ordered the shrimp po'boy. It was huge! Not only that, but very tasty and well worth the price. The shrimp is seasoned to perfection and the remoulade was very complimenting on the sandwich. I chose the bean salad as my side. Oh my, it was extremely tasty! The dressing is on point. I cannot believe I never dined there. Cannot wait to go back!\n",
            "Loved it! Located in a nice place in Dr Phillips. Ordered the philly stake croissant with eggs and it was delicious!\n",
            "I have been to this bar numerous times and have always found the staff helpful and the crowd to have a good time.  It seems to cater to a rather young crowd  yet the  staff from the  bar to the door are always right on top of things and see to it that everyone  is there to have a good time.  I strongly recommend this place to the local and the tourist when visiting. It is a must go to stop while visiting  the Austin music scene...\n",

During Shamu's show in the afternoon, we sat near the back of the stadium because we did not want to get wet.  However, the weather had other ideas and soon, horizon rains drenched everyone.  Ponchos must have sold well that day.\n",

            "Outstanding selection of meats and salad bar. While not cheap, but it is worth the special Times.  Next time I will skip the salad and get my fill on meat.\n",

            "Stopped here on a weekend boat ride for some drinks & apps.  We were an 8 person group. Two separate SERVICE comments.  1) The hostess: She was friendly enough, but absolutely pounding home all of the policies from the first moment.  (Are you all here?  Are you here for dinner or just drinks?, etc.)  I am fine with this and understand turnaround for a busy seasonal restaurant like this.  HOWEVER, it was 3:15pm; the place was empty, and we were only going to be around 30 minutes as we had to leave with the tide.  She kept telling me how busy it gets around 6pm. This comment did not apply to us.  She would not seat us outside despite multiple requests to do so.  The kids were eating dinner, and the adults just apps.  So, I would give the hostess 1 out of 5 stars for making us feel unwelcome, and for being 0% flexible and making each customer feel like the only customer.  \n",
            "2) The waitress:  She had a smile from ear to ear from the first moment, and moved us to outside.  \"Come here guys: I will take care of you....etc.\"  She was originally from Jersey, and was our key to having a great experience.  Simply put she was a 'yes' person compared to the 'no' person we first experienced.  Because of her we will be back.\n",

            "North Indian Food Buffet.  If you have been to an Indian buffet before then you know the jist of things.  This is an above average buffet with a very nice and jovial atmosphere.  The buffet itself includes standards such as Chicken Tikka and Saag Paneer.  Unlike some Indian restaurants however the quality of the chicken and vegetables here is top notch.  I enjoy the option to load up on chutney prior to entering the buffet foray.  Service was quick and staff were friendly.\n",

            "Been here a few times for brunch and I loved it. The best part are the $10 bottomless mimosas that they serve from 9-12pm (sometimes they will serve until 2pm depending on what time of the year it is). They have about 6 different options for mimosa flavors and if you sit outside and Mel is your waitress, ask for the mystery mimosa and you will not be disappointed! The one thing I like is that there are TVs everywhere! Both outside and inside, which makes Sunday football watching that much easier. The only reason I give this place four stars is because I have only eaten off their breakfast menu (which I would give 5 stars on its own). The rest of their menu is extensive as well, boasting your typical sports bar food with a few twists and signature dishes here and there. Definitely worth a visit if you are hungry before noon on a Sunday in the Lake Mary/Heathrow area!\n",

            "8/16/15 update\n",
            "Just enjoyed some amazing bottomless mimosas and brunch out on the patio on a rainy Sunday morning. Mel was our waitress and was awesome as always! There was one thing I was disappointed about: the chicken and waffles. I have had chicken and waffles at a few other places before and they were great! The offering here at Friendly Confines, however, was not worth the $10 price tag. Fluffier waffles and meatier chicken tenders would make this option so much more appealing. Just my two cents. Other than that, great experience despite my entree choice!\n",
            "Not fine dining, but a solid choice from the pub/bar niche.  Good happy hour specials (till 7) and friendly service. Lots of TVs in all sections, booths that fit 6, and close to the zoo.\n",
            "Unfortunately, they have stopped serving the 6 for $6 oysters, and the menu seems to have gotten smaller, with fewer items.  The food and wine are still good, and still expensive, but the overall trends seems to be downward.  Hopefully, this will not be another institution that loses its way.\n",
            "Great espresso and service! More variety of food compatible with coffee drinks and more room would have made me give 5 stars.\n",

Kaze Shabu Shabu is on the edge of Chinatown and is in a distinct purple cube. A friend had gotten reservations for five of us on a weeknight though upon entering it did not seem like they were needed. We sat at a booth which were comfortable though the backs of the chairs were thin (kids were sitting right in back of us and kept kicking the seats). The service was friendly though sometimes a little slow however the menu is quite extensive. I am use to just choosing from two or three broths but they had probably about three to four times that. Also they had a lot more beer and drinks to choose from but no smoothies. I settled on the tom yum broth ($3), seafood deluxe with udon ($18) and a hot tea. The tom yum was delicious but spicy and the seafood deluxe had a nice assortment from clams and squid to salmon and fish balls though I kept wondering if these were fresh (there was still some ice on the seafood). I was stuffed by the end and felt that the experience and price were reasonable so I think I would come back here again.\n",
            "Hot and crispy. The sides are done right. The chicken itself is yummy. It has some spice in it already which is great because no one likes bland anything.\n",
            "Workers are pretty \"meh\" here, but who cares...the food is phenomenal and if you do not want to talk to people, go through the drive through. The chicken sandwich is bomb, AND you can swap out a soda on your combo meal for a beer for ONLY 50 cents!!!\n",
            "\n",

            "This Place was nothing special. It was mediocre to any average breakfast place. I had a vegetarian breakfast burrito, it was huge! I finish half. It had scrambled eggs, black beans, onions and mushrooms. Salsa,  sour cream and avocado was on top. The potatoes on the side was crispy and perfect to go with my burrito. Over all. It a good place for breakfast.\n",
            "Snack sizes to try a flavour? YES! Lots of fantastic unique flavored such as maple honey, blueberry honey, Parmesan and herb? YES! Chicken was cooked perfectly well. Will I come back again? YES. Better than pocha and a thousand times better than dasarang ( who gave me raw chicken).\n",
            "Their handmade chocolate is a killer. My mouth melted as I put the chocolate in my mouth. Yes, literally melted. Service is friendly and attentive. Good ambience. Coffee is comparable to JJ Beans, hmmmm~ I will sure visit as often.\n",
            "I have come here on multiple occasions for their weekend brunch and have enjoyed them consistently. Some of my favorite dishes were the steam-fried buns, fried chive dumplings, braised pork bun, cold peanut noodles and fried radish cake. Their braised pork bun is my favorite in Boston. The meat is tender and flavorful, and is topped with mustard greens and crushed peanuts. \n",

            "A vegan friend of mine is obsessed with this restaurant, to the point where she eats here an average of three times a week, despite the fact that it is nowhere near her neighborhood. So of course I had to go when I visited Portland. Though the restaurant claims to serve Vietnamese food, their menu contains the greatest hits from asian food in general--curry, pad thai, pho, sushi roll appetizers, etc. I followed my friend' recommendation and had the combo, with the spicy vegan spareribs, which comes with vegetable soup. We also started with a couple of egg roll/spring roll appetizers. With every bite I wept for the fact that I will not be able to come back here for many months. \n",

We got some wine at the bar, the only bottle of Pinot Noir they had...of course from Argentina.  Cannot remember the name but I loved it.  During our 20 minute wait we sat on the benches outside and enjoyed the wine.\n",

            "So yes we ordered more of the same Pinot Noir wine for the meal.  Had the especial, it was beef tenderloin (cooked medium) with chimichurri and some cream sauce, fried potatoes, and green beans.  The steak was delectable with the sauce not overpowering.  The sides were good.\n",

The middle-eastern foods that I tasted here are almost similar to the ones that I had in middle east, so they do keep the authenticity.

They even offer samples and pairings. \"Can I have something like that... but with whiskey?\" is a common line I use and I am always happy with the result. These guys are not f*cking around. Go. Tonight. Trust me.\n",

            "Great breakfast sandwich at a great price!   If this is possible, more bacon than was needed. It quality of bacon was superb.  Cheese was high quality (gruyere or Swiss I believe).  Menu is diverse with lots of hidden treats.   I am definitely coming back to explore other areas of their menu!   To top it off their espresso macchiato was perfectly prepared and served.\n",
            "I stopped to this restaurant one night with a few of my vegetarian friends. The restaurant is very plain looking but the food makes up for that. There is only one item on the menu, lol, but you will not leave disappointed. They bring the food out on a circular tray and there are about 6 ramekins each containing a different food. It is served with rice and pita bread. When your stash is getting low they come back by and refill all your ramekins with more food. Everything was very tasty and the owner is extremely nice and funny. Would definitely go back to this place!\n",

After giving the menu a good once-over, we decided to grab a seat outside and dig in. Carolina, our server, was very friendly and helpful. The sangria was delicious, as were the two different empanadas I tried (de carne and negro). My partner in lunch crime was very pleased with his tacos (they were kind enough to morph a de carne empanada into a taco), and really liked the mango slaw. To top it all off, we realized there was a Scoutmob deal we could use, so it does not get any better than that. \n",

            "Rather amazed with the negative reviews. I have been coming here for lunch once a month for the last 12...never observing anything unappetizing. I always order chicken shawarma - swiftly prepared in under 5 min.  Always fresh & tasty & if you are on the move wrapped in foil to prevent leaks.  Do not know about dinner, late night, or delivery. But, if you are looking for a fast economical lunch, this place has it.\n",
            "Wow, looks like I am the first to review this new Red Robin,  I was driving along Hwy 14 yesterday and thought to myself, \"You know, I am really craving a good burger with some sweet potato fries\" then low and behold, there was Red Robin on the left!  So the boyfriend and I stopped in and the first thing we noticed was how new and clean the place was!  The staff was genuinely happy to see us and the service was quick.  The food was the same quality as most other Red Robin locations, which I suppose is good, since that is what most chains aim for.  I would definitely come again.  Happy Opening!\n",
            "Denmark is an interesting place. I went at a weird time, so I am not sure I got the whole vibe down pat. But at 4:30 on a Saturday, you can walk right up and take your pick of any seat in the house! They have got the bar, a little lounge area and high top tables. I was a little intimidated by the menu as I am not a big cocktail drinker, but it was really fun to try some of their house concoctions! Our waitress was helpful and offered suggestions based on what I like to drink and I needed up loving my cocktail! It had fresh pineapple, brandy...and about five other things that I had never heard of, but it was delicious! I also tried the chorizo pablano flat bread, and it was good to soak up some of that potent potion, but nothing to write home about. They also offer happy hour prices ($2 off) on the weekend!\n",

            "Really a 3.5 star place. Food was decent, we shared a watermelon salad, kale and avocado salad and tuna tartare. The restaurant itself was not busy at all when we got seated, however the service was really slow. Our waitress was trying to be nice and she was but everything took a while to get to us, our drinks and food.\n",
            "We ordered take-out from Desta, and overall, it was a good experience. The food was ready within ten minutes of ordering, and the food kept well on the way home. We ordered the sambusa appetizer and the lamb tibs. I really liked the sambusa, and the lamb tibs were good but not my favorite. I definitely think that I will return, but I will probably try a different entrée.\n",

They hire kids to hang out and manage the place- and the adults really do not give a damn, damn, damn about what is going on. If the food did not taste soo good, I would not waste my time.... A+ for the food. D- for the service.\n",

            "I used to come here often when I lived nearby. The sushi is good and the price is right. I always had to wait in line to dine in. Sometimes I would order over the phone so by the time I got there it was done and ready to go. I have also ordered the sushi for a party platter. It is consistently good and they are speedy.\n",

I could not find one thing to complain about. The beef teriyaki was flavorful and the crab Rangoon filling was very good as well. It was not too clumpy or powdery like some places are. The spareribs were juicy and full of flavor as well. I have no complaints considering what we ordered. Was going to order here last week for delivery but when we saw that there was a $3 delivery charge not including tip, it was a downfall. I think that is just a little overprice for delivery fee. I can understand if someone ordered less than $10 and they want to charge $3 but it is a lot if someone was to order here often.\n",

I had a bacon cheeseburger (it was lunch, and I just do not love steak enough to justify what restaurants charge for it), and my burger was only decent. The dinner rolls, however, were amazing. I also had a cup of chili which was very good as well. We may eventually dine here again, but this is definitely not a place we would go out of our way visit.\n",

The bartender(Chardonnay) was very nice and made an awesome margarita!!!! I ordered the Hippie Chickpea burger. The burger was very flavorful and sauce on top was delish. The burger was huge and I got full on half of it.  I also ordered the sweet potatoe fries but they had way too much salt on them. I had to wipe each waffle fry so much that it became time consuming so I gave up. I will be back to visit. Maybe more vegetarian options could be added.\n",

The menu is large and I doubt you would dislike anything you might order, but talk of it being \"the best Chinese food in Columbus\" makes me feel sort of cheated every time I go there.  I expect miracles, but the food here is definitely of an earthly variety.  That said, Hunan Lion is enjoyable and definitely suitable for a more \"upscale\" occasion or clientele.  The atmosphere is a notch above usual \"Chinese restaurant\" style, the restaurant can accomodate large groups, there is a full bar and large menu of tropical drinks, and the service is good - but my loyalties lie elsewhere.  3.5 stars.\n",

We came on a Sunday afternoon and it was not super packed which was nice considering you cannot even expect to get into tatsuya or michi during brunch hours in under 90 minutes. It was a tad short staffed so the service left something to be desired, however we were seated promptly at the bar and were well taken care of. The space is also bigger than the other ramen restaurants in Austin and has a patio area. I tried the Tonkatsu black and it was good as well. The broth was rich without being too salty and the pork belly had a good amount of meat on it. Price is a little too high but I am still looking forward to trying the other ones!\n",

This restaurant, in the Rosen Shingle Resort, is among the best in the area, which is why, we could not believe how empty it was on a Friday evening.  It certainly was not because of the food or service which were superb!  All our entrees (pan seared scallops, grouper, seabass and braised short ribs) were a good size and scrumptious.  JJ, our server, was both very personable and helpful.  For the amazing quality of the food, this definitely is a great place to dine.\n",

            "I have been searching high and low in Boston for some good Mexican food, not super authentic or anything  just a little more like the deliciousness I have come across in NYC and Cali. El Potro is one of the best I have found in the Boston area. They also get points in my book because they have such a fun, colorful interior and mariachis. These mariachis are great too, good singers and do not make you feel self conscious when they approach your table. Also I am a vegetarian who loooves mole sauce and I can barely find anywhere where mole is offered not on chicken, El Potro offers it though and mmm it is soo good. Check it out for a fun night of yummy Mexican food!\n",

Today I went again and got the combination plate with the Shish Kabob (beef tenderloin), the Kufta Kobab (grilled ground beef infused with house spices), and gyro slices served with salad rice and pita bread. I will be honest. This is one of the few times I have gotten full from JUST the entree, the combination plate had that much food. \n",

            "Let Us break the meat down, the Kufta kabob was my favorite by far. it looks kind of like a homemade burned sausage which made me hesitate, but when i bit into it. OMG. my mouth exploded with flavor. Whatever they are mixing into the ground beef, i definitely want some of that. Even though it looked burned, it had plenty of moisture. Also, it was not greasy at all. They might use 93-7 beef, or it may be because they make them over the grill, but there definitely was not that greasy feeling that you get when you eat ground been made with 80-10 or even 85-15. and if you want to make a ghetto greek hot dog , you can also put this with a gyro. \n",
            "\n",
            "The gyro meat was also very good. they give you A TON of it. and its flavorful and moist. i really like to use them with the pita bread to basically make my own gyros with the taziki sauce and salad thrown in. And once you run out of pita bread, you can eat it with the rice. \n",
            "\n",
            "The only disappointing thing about the dish was the shish kabob. it was just cooked too much. With such a small piece of beef it should really only be cooked till medium rare, but they definitely cooked it till medium. It also was not seasoned very well. so it was the most plain of all the meats, and it was also the dryest.\n",
            "\n",
            "All they need to do is make the beef less dry, i wonder if i can ask for the beef kabob medium rare, then it would definitely be a 5 star dish. BUT NOW I REALLY WANT TO GET THE KUFTA KABOB plate. !!!\n",

The goat cheese and radicchio app was sensational. Friends had the meatball with polenta which was great. Penne Bolognese was superb. Bread was served with roasted garlic that was also one of the best ever. Drinks were not very good. Sign in lobby said happy hour 3-5, but fine print said \"join us are the bar\" and they would not honor in restaurant which is causing us to give 4 stars instead of five.\n",

            "Healthy and fresh! We tried acai bowl and dragon bowl, both were delicious and plenty for a lunch meal (if you want), or an afternoon snack, super yummy! A little expensive, 2 bowls for $23, but it is worth getting a super healthy treat for your body!\n",

            "Went here with a few people early on a Saturday, it was pretty empty but it was great because we did not have to wait for anything. Played a round of bowling for 3 for $25, also played a few games of pool and it was about $10. I tried their Chicken Bite Trio (BBQ, Buffalo, and Ranch) and Coconut Shrimp, both were what you would expect for good bar food. They have taken away the vast majority of arcade games over the last few years. I have also been here before on a Saturday night because they show UFC fights here as well.\n",

            "We got there at 2:20m and we were sitted around 2:45pm, 15 minutes before they close for the lunch.\n",
            "I liked the dark chocolate sauce, but it was little bit milky or buttery for me and not dark enough as I love bitterness of the dark chocolate. The waffle was okay, but it could be better if you get a fresh one when they just make it as I got one from the shelf.\n",
            "I liked the Paella with the sunnyside egg on top of it and I enjoyed it and finished it.\n",
            "Everything was good, but I did not like their latte.\n",
            "I bet the restaurant makes good money, but they do not take American express so be prepared to pay with other payment methods.\n",
            "Will come back for the brunch again.\n",
            "MANGO SEASON!!  Ripe and delicious!  Stop by with the family and everyone enjoyed the Mango bubble shake.  We tried bubble waffle .. little bit on the sweeter side then expected. Other then the cramped space, we love the drinks.\n",
            "This is our go-to spot for movie viewing. Love this place. I always get the pizza and an IPA on tap. Cannot imagine going to any other theatre now that I am spoiled with eating and drinking at Alamo Drafthouse.\n",

            "Keep in mind that the space is small, so try to get there a little early for the music. All the seats are good, but there are always a couple empty in the front that are certain to blast your ears away. Steer clear of those if you want to keep your ears.\n",

Oh, I guess all those things could be done any other day of the week as well. Give it a shot!\n",
            "Second time coming here while in Austin, the wait is always extremely long but both times it is been worth it if you have the time. I had the migas the first time and second time the crab cake Benedict. Super yummy. I would recommend a Bloody Mary aswell\n",

A bit of a \"dive bar\" atmosphere, but service is always prompt and friendly. Prices are affordable. Great jukebox. Casual, low-key environment.\n",
            "Fun, boisterous place near Copley that has a large menu of small plates and an enticing array of drink options. The prices are mid range leaning toward high, but the great part of it is you can order a bunch of different options and try a few things and not destroy your budget (though you can do some damage if you go overboard on the drinks).\n",

I have been in Orlando for a decade now and I find it so strange how different the Chinese food is here from Miami. I have stopped searching and just order from here. Then when I visit my hometown, I get my chinese and Cuban food fix there.\n",
            "B&G is delicious. I went with my parents and got the Lobster Roll. Pretty pricy but the seafood is very fresh. Props to Barbara Lynch.\n",
            "I got Pad Ped (which is stir fried bell pepper, onion, green beans, and choice of meat) and it was really really good. The pork was marinated so well and not dried. However, if there had been more food I would have given 5 stars. I felt like I just got a little bit of everything :( I will try their other dishes for sure.\n",
            "Yum! Ate here for a friend's wedding reception dinner.  It was quite the feast, and we got quite the show with the flaming cheese.  The service was great and the food was tasty! The restaurant has some charm to it, as well.\n",
            "I try to rate the food and ambience not by location so here is my take. I live only a few blocks away and was a fan of this place before the neighborhood blew up  and started to attract the hipster dipshits.\n",

            "Try the mushroom ravioli.\n",
            "Had a great dinner here - first time at this place and the food did not disappoint.  Took the advice of our server and ordered the cucumber dip and it was a great accompaniment.  Lavas bread was really yummy as well.  The only reason we cannot give this 5 stars was due to slow service, the fact that middle row of tables (where we  sat) means you are nearly constantly in the middle of a thoroughfare of servers going back and forth.  Parking is also a little tough to come by on a Saturday night, but that is typical for Park drive.  Prices are very reasonable and the Turkish wine was very tasty.  We will try this again in the future and hope for a little more punctual service.\n",
            "For the price, I thought it was pretty good. I had a taco that was just like the Dirty Sanchez from Torchy's . \n",
            "\n",
            "Service was a little slow, but nothing horrendous.\n",
            "Came here for lunch and it was very tasty.  The wait was actually quite long so we put our name on the list and walked around Uwajimaya while we waited.  Once seated, we both got the deluxe miso ramen and it was excellent - I would definitely get it again.  The kids got very lightly fried gyoza and enjoyed that too.\n",

            "Brought a date here a couple weeks ago and had a very good experience.  I ordered the eggplant parmesean (my go-to Italian dish, especially at a new place), and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked and seasoned well, although they went a little bit heavy on the cheese for my taste.  I would been told that many of their dishes have a lot of cheese, so I was not shocked.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had made a late dinner reservation just in case, but we probably would have been fine without it.  We were seated promptly, and out server was very attentive, especially to our drinks.  We did not have any wine or dessert, so I cannot comment on those aspects of the menu.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, we both enjoyed our experience and would gladly return.  The food and service was very good, and I thought the prices were reasonable.  There definitely more expensive specialty dishes, but the staples are very affordable.  Excellent atmosphere, too.\n",
            "This was a last minute decision to stop by and we were PLEASANTLY surprised. It was a bit crowded, but we were able to get a table for 7 pretty quick. Service was wonderful even though all we wanted were drinks. \n",
            "\n",
            "They gave us complimentary sparkling water, biscuits and rolls. We did order some dishes such as the arctichoke rolls (only served two rolls) and a ARE & R chopped salad. Both were delicious..however, the portion was small for the price.   What was BIG for the price was the Devil's Food Chocolate Cake..HUGE HUGE HUGE..they had the entire cake on display. It was about 7 inches high! Delicious..not too sweet with the ice cream either! \n",

We live in the north end and everyone asks.. :\"what is your favorite spot\"?  ITs my house... or Prezza. There are a few other spots which i will review. Always get the shrimp fried in phyllo dough... or their soups. NOT a main course person.. I would rather three appetizers.\n",
            "My coworker and I went to Animal Kingdom - mostly because we wanted to go to Animal Kingdom, but we wanted to check out the Festival of Lights too. To be able to get some PRIME spots during the show, we decided to do the Festival of Lights meal. \n",

            "I think their brioche dough is awesome and I am a huge fan of their original and buttermilk flavors; but I will say most of the specialty flavors with berry or fruit, I have found too tart (blueberry basil, the marionberry with PB powder, the lemon one, passionfruit cocoa nib). Could just be my taste buds though. Outside of the buttermilk/original ones, I have not found anything I love, but their dough is undeniably good.\n",
            "I just found my go-to place for Chinese delivery in East Somerville. My General Gau's Chicken was light and spicy, and the veggie fried rice was also light and flavorful. The Crab Rangoon could be better, but I would easily order it again. Bonus points for the delivery driver arriving sooner than stated.\n",
            "Excellent cafe place to have some good times with friends. Great environment and very quite. So far i have been several times over there. They have one of the best fruit  and bubble tea. I would recommend everyone to have try their pastry and house blend coffee..\n",

            "On a recent trip to Austin, my friends and I almost ran out of time for meals, however, we really wanted to try Barley Swine after reading all their rave reviews. We had no idea how to squeeze a 12-course meal into our schedule. Luckily, we discovered they offer a very attractive happy hour from 5:30pm on weekdays and since you can walk in and dine without reservations, we had to take advantage of this opportunity. \n",
            "\n",
            "We arrived and were seated at a long, shared table immediately. The atmosphere inside Barley Swine is casual and upbeat, with an open kitchen and charmingly unique decorations. There are only about 10 or so choices on the happy hour menu, and we decided to order most of them. We enjoyed the following:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Yellowtail, pistachio, carrot\n",
            "* Pig face pot stickers\n",
            "* Pupusa, refried beans, sesame\n",
            "* Grilled Richardson farm pork ribs\n",
            "* Southern fried chicken, sorghum, leek\n",
            "\n",
            "The table's favorite was the southern fried chicken, with its tasty sauce and delicious, juicy fried pieces of generous meat. I really enjoyed the flavor of the ribs, which were my personal favorite. The meat on the ribs were tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone and cooked to perfection. Their take on Yellowtail was also very delicious, as were the pig face pot stickers. The pupusa was cooked very well and presented beautifully, but it was the least favored at the table. I really appreciate the different flavors, textures, and creativity Barley Swine is able to bring in such compact dishes, and it is very obvious their ingredients are fresh and of the best quality. I think you really have to appreciate food to truly enjoy the experience here, and I am so glad we were able to squeeze Barley Swine into our schedule. I would love to come back for a real meal but if you are like us and want to get your feet wet, the happy hour seems a great way to go about it!\n",
            "If the cozy restaurants of NYC's West Village have a special place in your heart, like they do in mine, you do not have to travel 200 miles south to find one. Warmth and intimacy can be found at Metropolis in the South End.\n",
            "\n",
            "My girlfriend and I had no trouble finding a table on a Wednesday night. With the temperatures below 30 degrees, the risotto dish for her and braised short rib entree for me seemed fitting. Although we did not partake, the appetizers looked excellent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, Metropolis is an excellent place to get out of the cold and meet a close friend or date. I would not recommend coming with more than two people as seating is limited.\n",
            "After flying in from California and taking two trains to get to Concord in the evening, I needed a little soul-brightening before I walked the mile to my relative's place at 9 pm.  I sidled up to the bar, ordered oysters and a white wine. The bartender took care to make sure I ordered exactly what I would like and gave me tastings of 3 wines. \n",
            "I also purchased a dozen eggs from their affiliated farm to take home. \n",
            "Great atmosphere. Worth the $30 tab at the end of it all.\n",
            "Super cool relaxed bar. Draft beer prices were good, although the selection was a little weak as far as hoppy options were concerned. \n",
            "Had the 'Boulder Mule' which was delicious and not too sweet. Whole bar had a very relaxed feel, felt like you could hang out here and not be constantly bothered.\n",
            "Will definitely be back.\n",
            "Historic, fun pub with good, hearty food as well as light salads, and good beer. Live music occasionally. A fun place to hang out and enjoy the scenery. Definitely a great place to take visiting friends or relatives.\n",
            "I would give it five stars if it were not so damn sketchy! Old rundown trailer painted bright yellow. Food was great, I had the 3 rib dinner with red beans & rice and collard greens(my first) ribs were smokey(like they should be) and slathered with a good bbq sauce, collard greens were great, red beans & rice are the best I have had in a long while! My wife had the mac & cheese, which was very good too. Cannot wait to go back!\n",
            "I went to Hopdoddy for the first time over the weekend, and I was not let down.  We skipped the line and decided to sit at the bar.  I ordered a frozen margarita, which was good and I like that they use local and all natural ingredients.  I really wanted the Backyard Martini (Cucumber infused and made with Honeydew Kombucha, but could not bring myself to pay the high price.  However, I did notice that they have a great beer selection served in rather large glasses.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The burgers are DELICIOUS.  Especially their version of the veggie burger...SO yum.  My friend got the cookie milkshake and it was pretty tasty.  I loved the atmosphere, very fun, trendy, laid-back, unique.  Perfect for Austin!\n",

            "\n",
            "I normally stay away from non-traditional Chinese restaurants but whenever I am craving American Chinese food this is the place I go. I have ordered several entrees off of their menu and have enjoyed most of them that I have ordered. The general Tso chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken are my favorites at this restaurant. \n",
            "\n",
            "Also, something on the menu I would recommend is their donuts (I know what you are thinking but just trust me). They fry them to order and they are really tasty.\n",
            "I loved this place... Different, well priced, pretty good, and well located, but unfortunately it is closed for some reason.\n",
            "Are you looking for a comfortable, clean, and sophisticated place, along with a good dinner in the evening? Well, if you said yes, this place may have your answer. Noche is the Spanish word for night and this place's specialty is Latin American and Spanish influenced cuisine served in a refined, classy, sophisticated, yet comfortable interior. \n",
            "\n",
            "Once you get seated and after you make your order, they serve you some Plaintain Chips. Plaintains are a fruit that are relatives to the banana and they are usually served fried. They were salted and are really crispy. I liked the flavor of the dipping sauce, and it is a good start to the meal. \n",
            "\n",
            "The main entree that I ordered was the Chicken, Chorizo and Local Shellfish Paella. Paella is a pan-fried rice dish, mixed with saffron that is originally from Spain. Chorizo is a Spanish sausage with some spice in the flavor. This Paella dish also has a lobster tail, mussels, shrimp and clams. Presentation was impressive, and the portions were excellent. The seafood overall was tasty, but I thought the meat from the mussels were small. The lobster was pretty good and the shrimp was plump. The Chorizo tasted really well with the fried rice. This is a great choice if you are really hungry, and should be enough to fill the stomach of one man. It is also a great dish to share with two people who are not so hungry or for four people who want something really light to complement the small plates that they serve here. It was probably not the best Paella, but it was one of the best Paella dishes I had in Boston so far. \n",
            "\n",
            "As for other dishes, I thought the best tapas dish was the Squid, Avocado and Chorizo Fritters. This is a fried dish, and I really liked the aioli sauce which made the crispy squid tastier. The Slow Roasted Turkey Leg Tamales are a really good choice, and I thought they were tasty, but needs a little more turkey inside. The Noche Mini Burgers are a great choice if you want a snack at the bar. I was not impressed with the Tacos. They were out of steak, so instead we settled on getting Grilled Pork Tacos instead of Grilled Steak. The Tacos were good, but not great. We also got a Pork Arepas dish, which is this dough made from cornmeal that is fried with pork and barbecue sauce. It was also a good dish. It was supposed to be the Smoked Beef Brisket and Corn Arepas. \n",
            "\n",
            "I decided to get the Churros for dessert. Churros are a type of fried dough doused with sugar. I have not eaten Churros since I left Sevilla, so I wanted to see how this place does. After the first bite, I was very impressed. It had a nice sugary sweetness on the outside, and a nice warm chewiness on the inside. It brought back some great memories, and it is definitely a dessert worth ordering. \n",
            "\n",
            "One major disadvantage is that they sometimes run out of certain food, such as beef, and you may need a secondary choice ready. If they can seriously improve on this, it has a lot of potential to be a better restaurant. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you want to eat here during a night out in the city, especially during weekends, it is highly advisable that you make a reservation in advance, since this place was heavily booked during a Saturday night. Although the dress code may be casual here, the interior is really classy and sophisticated compared to a lot of restaurants in this somewhat decent city, you should probably wear something impressive (maybe a collared shirt by Calvin Klein and a pair of Kenneth Cole slacks?). Ladies should also wear something impressive and stylish. \n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, this is a great choice if you want a fine and tasty dinner. This place may not have Boston's finest food, but it is still a good choice, and it is also a great choice if you really want a sophisticated atmosphere. This is probably the type of place I would consider returning with a few friends and a good amount of money for some sophisticated, classy and somewhat stylish fun dining.\n",
            "I have never tried the actual food, but I am a regular at this place for fro yo. it is the best in Boston! service can sometimes be slow, but it is well worth the wait. My personal favorite fro yo combination is vanilla with oreo and cookie dough.\n",
            "I LOVE coming here! I have been quite a few times for dinner, but I want to try brunch soon. \n",
            "\n",
            "My menu highlights: crispy brussel sprouts, calamari, shrimp n grits, burger, seared tuna, and some cajun-inspired pasta dish that I cannot remember the actual name of. Everything I have tasted there has been great though, I do not think you can really go wrong. Service is excellent every time. Only docking one star because it is just a bit over priced for me.\n",
            "Not sure what all the hate is about! I enjoyed our meal immensely. Keep in mind, it is a chain, but a good one at that. First off, their margaritas are awesome! No sour mix here! Also I appreciate places that have yummy vegetarian and vegan options. My favorite is the vegetarian combo. Do not forget to ask for creamy jalapeño sauce for your chips.\n",
            "I got turned on to Baraonda by some friends of mine from Italy who worked there.  They were telling me that the food there was really close to where they live in Italy.  Well since I have been to Italy, and wanted real Italian food...I decided to give it a try!  Yes, they were right...it was delicious!  I do wish their food menu had more selections, but I LOVE the pizza there. That is all I ate in Italy when I went, and now I can have it here in the ATL. Who would have known!!  After living in NYC for a while and being able to get any type of pizza I want...this will definitely do the trick for me! Grazie Baraonda!\n",
            "Also if you are going to a show at The Fox, make a reservation here before or after the show!\n",
            "Excellent food. Nachos, taco salad, enchiladas suizas, tacos, and just about everything else I have tried have been awesome. Decent bottled beer selection. Interior is nice, but we usually do take-out.\n",
            "I have been here a handful of times since they opened and the food and drinks have been great every time. Great margarita. The steak tips and burgers were awesome, along with the coconut shrimp and onion rings as starters. I would highly recommend the chicken caesar salad wrap--The chicken is charred and delicious, and the pita/tortilla wrap is super fresh and tastes homemade! \n",
            "\n",
            "This place gets LOUD on a weekend night, the acoustics are terrible. It is hard to hear anyone even across the table so if that is something that bothers you, I would give it a chance on a weekday. \n",
            "\n",
            "One thing I would suggest they work on is their take out system. Went in on a Sunday evening to pick up our to-go order, asked the hostess and she said she does not handle the pick up orders, the bartender does. It took about 5 minutes to even get his attention, as the bar was pretty packed and he served and made drinks for a few guests that had arrived after me. All the while, two waitresses and the hostess were standing there with nothing to do. It just seems a little silly to give the takeout orders AND the bar to the busiest guy in the place. It would have been a lot smoother had the hostess been able to help, or one of the waitresses.\n",
            "Uchiko for dinner last night.  I can sum it up in one word...awesome...pricey, but awesome.  Starting with the Madai (incredible); moving to Shishito Yaki grilled peppers (yummy); then on to Cobia, Hagatsuo, Isaki, Kodai, Tennen Hirame and Tennen Kanpachi sashimi (so tender and flavorful); Gyutoro (melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful); and, finishing up with Shimi Saba (my sushi chefs personal favorite.  I can see why).\n",
            "Always a must stop when visiting Columbus.  The food is better than most German Restaurants.  Although it is always busy and noisy. I think that the surrounding Germantown neighborhood, brick paved streets and the restaurant's history add to the experience. If you wait for your table outside, you think you are in Germany.  Make sure you drive through the surrounding blocks for a unique look at how a renovation of old town can be done correctly. After you have had a homemade Cream Puff of course!\n",
            "This is a great place to go for happy hour, a drink or snack. It is usually not too crowded. The service is good. The food and drinks are above average. Their guacamole is delicious and they offer a few great versions of spicy cocktails.\n",
            "A nice little restaurant with friendly staff and good food. The bread was nice and moist, they also gave some pickled carrots, olives and cauliflower. Both the pastas that we had were amazing and richly flavored - Raviolini and Cappellini Al Pesto. To end it all equally delicious dessert - Tiramisu which was light and creamy. The Spumoni was a let down, we expected something great with the elaborate description on the menu. All in all a nice place to go for a date night. \n",
            "\n",
            "I do not think they take reservations seriously so be prepared to wait at the bar for a good 15-20 minutes to be seated on a friday/saturday night. Nice selection of drinks at the bar though so no complaints.\n",
            "Small restaurant in a small plaza, but do not let the outside fool you. This place serves high-end Cantonese cuisine, and their food is usually very good. Their sweet and sour pork and beef & mushroom on sizzling iron plate are some of the best I have had. And that special duck dish you have to pre-order is pretty amazing. They would get five stars for the food, but their service can be lacking at times, and they have had issues honoring reservations when they are really busy. Probably would not go there during a holiday when they are super busy, but for any other times they have some of the best Cantonese food in the area.\n",
            "Casual place for excellent tacos! One taco for $2.50 or four tacos for $9. Get four tacos and you can order four different taco flavours. Lots of choices. The place will be busy and you can either eat there or take out. The flavours are excellent and it comes hot as it is just made. Despite the lineups, once ordered it will arrive very promptly. The cashier is super friendly and the staff are equally as personable. Totally recommend this place for yummy tacos. Try the beef tongue.\n",
            "ate here on a recent Thursday nite. We arrived about 7.30 for a late dinner. Their were three parites in their. We were seated quickly our drink order taken. Placed my order of drunken noodles and eggplant(auburgines) and vegetables. They did not have my first choice which is silver noodles.Waittress said they had silver noddles however it was not on the menu or avaible to the public. Anyway. the two plates i ordered both had two chili peppers next to them on the menu. i assume that meant that it was hot and spicy. however, my food was not spicy or hot at all. Other than not being spicy like i enjoy. the food was fine. I will even say it was very good.  portions were fine. I had specifically asked for fresh chili peppers on the side to give some kick to my food. It just may have been a communication gliche  because the waitress brought me dried chilli powder. Both orders had lots of fresh vegetables and they were crisp and not over cooked. which is perfect. Briocolli, zuchinni, carrots, onions, mushrooms. and plenty of them. And fresh mushrooms not the rubbery tinned mushrooms that many restaurants use to save money. They have brown rice which is a big plus also. \n",
            "\n",
            "The only complaint i have is the price. drunked noodles at $11 and spicy eggplant(augurgines) at $13 . Perhaps the high price is because of the location. high rent and overhead. and being a distance from the city. Bill came to $28 and i left $3 tip. \n",
            "I will return, its worth  it. tastey food and plenty of fresh vegetables.\n",
            "I grew up in Newton and then moved away for awhile. My family is still around and when I go home this is always one of the first things I want to get. I love this style of pizza! Yum. Nothing like a good \"House of Pizza.\"\n",
            "I went here soon after it opened a few years ago. Great iced tea. That has not changed. I am a tea fan, so I know what I am yelping about in this regard. I have heard the food is pretty decent.\n",
            "I originally became aware of Blue Star while watching one of the food shows on TV and made it part of my bucket list in life to visit in person. Literally, Blue Star was a fundamental motivator in planning a weekend trip to Portland. And it did not disappoint!\n",
            "\n",
            "The shops in Portland (there are several locations throughout Portland - which makes it a great stop in between breweries) are clean, open, airy and full of light - which is somehow very refreshing.\n",
            "\n",
            "During my four day trip I made it a point to visit Blue Star each day and try a different variety of donuts. Overall my favorites were the old fashioned - I found the brioche to be a bit tough and dry in texture. Of the old fashioned the Bourbon Basil Blueberry and seasonal Lemon Thyme powder sugar were my absolute favorite - I wish I would have gotten some to take home and keep in the freezer! They also were featuring the seasonal fritter - carrot zatar - which was crispy on the outside, had real carrot and spices, moist and tender on the inside and a nice balance between sweet-sugary-ness and crunchy fried fattiness. \n",
            "\n",
            "My least favorites were the peanut butter and jelly brioche (which literally tasted like a peanut butter jelly sandwhich but with jalapeno - a little confusing and not very satisfying in a donut) and the passion fruit brioche with paprika - which I literally spit out after one bite. I also had high expectations of the crème brulee but found it had way too much of a sugar crunch topping and too dry of a center - it would have been better with a vanilla or grand marnier custard in the middle. \n",

Pool tables and a game room are available, with free pool on Sundays. Serving staff were efficient and friendly without being intrusive.\n",

The only thing is charging $1 per springroll is a bit too much especially for the size of the rolls. Coffee is a bit watered down. I wish it could be a bit more bitter and pure like what you expect in a Vietnamese coffee. You expect them to be bigger and more filled with fillings. Bun bo hue is good. Pretty much everything is good. Not a disappointment.\n",

When we arrived to the bar around 10 PM, it was not very busy, and felt a bit slow for a weekend night. We had no issues finding a table to sit, and within a few minutes of sitting, were greeted by our server who dropped off the draft beer menu, and asked if we had ever been to World of Beer before. As we had been here several times already, we answered yes, and she welcomed us back, and let us know about an upcoming event they had with Funky Buddha. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu before returning to take our orders. \n",

Moving on from there, I tried to get a Blueberry Honey Wheat beer from FatHead brewing, but sadly that too was out of stock. Finally, I ended up getting the Blood Orange IPA originally requested, but from a bottle rather than draft. The beer was okay, although it was my fault for ordering as I am not usually a huge fan of IPAs. Prices were a bit high, around $6 a beer, but because of their huge selection, I am not sure what kind of bulk pricing they get. \n",

Although I am not too much of a fan when it comes to burgers that create a mess and leak oils and juices. Everything just got all over my hands. Next time I will probably end up trying their peanut butter burger. But the taste of the EPIC definitely gets a 5/5 in my books!

This place is definitely at the top.  And I was so excited to see saganaki without shrimp in it, because that is my favorite dish but I can never find it just plain.

The mountain of shaved ice was densely packed and smooth almost powdery; not rough and crunchy. Half way through the Bingsu you got to the pool of fruit juice on the bottom of the bowl ... mmmmmmmmmm Heaven!

Definitely your typical Portland brunch spot, with a wait, but if you know Portland you know that \"typical\" sets the bar pretty high. I had a standard eggs, sausage, and potatoes plate that did not disappoint. They also bring out these biscuits that are melt in your mouth amazing.

Love the toppings bar where I could put anything on my burger how I wanted to. The nacho cheese on the wedge fries were great. When I took my first bite of my burger, the flavor gates flung open and almost broke off the hinges. The burger is definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had and I could not stop eating! I almost finished my burger but I could not make it. I was as full as a tick and I wanted to roll over and go to sleep. I could only go up to the dessert counter and stare at the desserts because there was no way I could possibly get one down. Mark my words....I will be back and hopefully I can fit dessert into the equation somehow.\n",

My only wish is that they would carry some authentic British ales and/or some American Craft ales.  It seems like a shame to have such great, authentic food and miss out on the bitters or milds to go with it.  Budweiser and Coors are fine on a hot summer afternoon at the beach and if those are your beers of choice I would not begrudge you, but I would really love to have some awesome English style ales with my food here.

Is this vaunted, beloved status deserved?  Absolutely.

You can get chunks of their delicious signature sausages and other German favorites like German potato salad (which tastes exactly like what my great-grandmother used to make, so comforting), red cabbage (so delicious) and more American comfort food choices like mac and cheese and meatloaf.  For more traditional German dishes like sauerbraten and wienerschnitzel, you will need to order off the menu.\n",

The bf ordered a scrambled egg, a side of bacon, and a waffle with maple syrup. Everything was great - the bacon was pretty epic. I had the La Sante, a waffle with milk chocolate lavender dipping sauce, and a lavender latte. The server was surprisingly helpful in making my decision, explaining what my two options were and which one was more food. My latte was delicious, the La Sante was a perfectly French breakfast that was just enough food, and the milk chocolate lavender dipping sauce - well, I could just licked the bowl clean. Amazing.\n",

They do not just have a pot of coffee, your regular cup of coffee will be an Americano (or a Canadiano, as the case may be), so it takes a few. Be patient, the guy's going as fast as he can. :) Cafe Medina is on my list as a place to eat when visiting Vancouver next time.\n",

            "For entrees. I had the Chilean Sea Bass, four words - melted in the mouth. My mom thought it was a bit too fatty for her taste, but I like it just right. My mom had the Seafood combination, which I found was consisted of quality ingredients. All the seafood taste fresh and the texture is right. Just a side note, if you ever get seafood from a regular Chinese take out place, the shrimp is usually mushy because they soak them in soda water and  the scallops usually taste of preservatives. I think Steel got their seafood right (for roughly three times the price, they better). Lastly, my dad had the sea salt chicken, overcooked and dried. Bummer. \n",

Thinking about this burger also brings me to my next thought about this place; there is nothing \"plain\" here. Every burger and sandwich has some extra element whether it is pimento cheese cheese, a special sauce, or guacamole. Sure you can ask for them to take it off, but I do not think that is the point. \n",

Started with the eggplant tower and then my boyfriend and I both ordered the rib-eye steak which was served with a generous portion of mac&cheese and asparagus. The steak was delicious and we both had plenty to take home. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and quick - wish I could remember her name!\n",
            "Had lunch here in the middle of the week. There were only two other people in the restaurant when we walked in at 1 pm. The service was a little slow, but not bad. The food was excellent! My daughter had chicken tacos and I had fish tacos with salmon. Both were very tasty. Beverages are a little expensive ($3.50 for soda, $3 for iced tea). Chips and salsa both appeared to have been made in-house and were delicious. Parking is limited but there were a couple of spots open. Great place for a casual meal, but not if you are in a hurry. Staff (owner?) was very nice.\n",

            "This review is of the Sunday lunch buffet ($12/person) at the restaurant that is widely spoken of as the best Indian in Austin. I was there once before, April 2010, before moving to Austin, for a dinner that had mixed results (e.g. chicken tikka masala ruined by vinegar). However, the buffet yesterday fared much better and I can whole heartedly recommend it for its taste, wide variety and price appropriate for its environment. Yet, it is not superb and far from traditional. But just may be the best available and certainly satisfying.\n",
            "\n",
            "The buffet was a hit with three veggie dishes, three meat/chicken dishes, one fish dish, nice array of condiments, mini-samosas, naan served at the table and two well executed desserts. (I ignored the salad and two soups.)\n",
            "\n",
            "The three vegetable dishes were all winners but of different degrees. The vegetable korma was the standout success, the best korma I have had in Austin and many other places, with nice tofu amidst the other veggies. The saag chana dish was quite good with firm chick pea. The consistency of this dish was not as sickeningly rich and pureed like the entree served at Clay Pit last April -- that is a plus! Eggplant had generous amount of peas and good flavor, although very oily but that is often the case with eggplant.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the meats, the chicken tandoori is superb, especially if you time it when the plate is being refreshed which they do regularly (old, dry tandoori chicken is a big failing of other restaurant buffets). The lamb with peppers featured very good quality meat although a little spice heat would have enhanced it. The mahi mahi featured very nicely prepared fish, moist and tender, cut into perfect size pieces in a \"mango\" sauce which really seemed more like coconut flavor. A winner. Chicken curry was merely \"acceptable\" due to overabundance (imbalance) of mushrooms and an inferior yellow curry reminiscent of what you would get in a Chinese restaurant or a store bought package... but that could be me. I do not like that variety. Either way, the mushrooms killed it. Overall, the meat/chicken/fish dishes scored high. There was a very thin yellow dahl soup (unnecessary) and another soup I did not try. \n",
            "\n",
            "I would use dahl as a topping on very spicy dishes of which there were none. Many dishes had abundant flavor but no heat, which I would have liked. There was a hot sauce offered on the side but that is a mere palliative compared to adding fresh chilies to the making of a dish. Oh well. They win again.\n",
            "\n",
            "The mini-samosas were quite good, not too fried and greasy with an interior of pureed potatoes although my dining companion identified other veggies as well. The \"usual suspects\" in condiments included a very nice tamarind \"chutney\" which worked well over the samosa and tandoori chicken. We did not try the dried chick peas and make our own \"chat.\" Desserts were strong conclusion: kheer rice pudding with slivered cashews and a fine, heated gulab jamon ball in which the syrup was appropriately thin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now for the constructive criticism. I wanted some information on the food being served and, just like my dinner last year, there was nobody available who knows the first thing about Indian food, what is in it, which region it comes from, etc. The \"best\" Indian restaurant in the state capital must do better, e.g. when they told me that most of the dishes served were south Indian in origin. Really? Saag chana, korma, tandoori chicken, bengan bartha (eggplant), samosas, papri chat, dahl, gulab jamon?\n",
            "\n",
            "Other criticism from my companion is the ladies room is dark and dingy. I thought the men's room was fine. Certainly, the overall environment is refined and comfortable. It is a beautiful building.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am going back to the Clay Pit for dinner to have the entrees, the kebobs and tandoori specialties, the kashmiri rogan ghosh and the other curries. Dinner may be a different story. Suppose I will have to go for the \"fusion\" dishes, too, such as curried mussels and coriander calamari. But meanwhile, I endorse the Sunday buffet (note: larger and more expensive than Mon-Sat).\n",
            "\n",
            "UPDATE:  Went back for dinner and it is horrible.  Khuroosh-e-tursh, chicken tikadar and tamarind coconut shrimp (with tamarind chutney in sauce).  Too painful to go thru the details, but it is bad.  Except this time the server was knowledgeable.\n",
            "My husband and I went to Saus for dessert after having eaten a very large pasta meal in the North End.  We have enjoyed waffles in Belgium in the past but the best way to eat a waffle is at the Waffe Cabin (previously known as Waffle Haus) in various New England ski mountains.  Given that we have eaten plenty of waffles before, I had little expectations for Saus' waffles.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Saus' decor has a fun vibe, ample seating with no frills.  Just a fun place to go, get your food and chow down.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We ordered a waffle with no accompaniments.  That is the way we were used to eating it in Belgium and on the ski slopes.  I was a little disappointed to see that they took a waffle that was already made from the cooling rack and put it back on the iron.  I asked them about that and if I could get one fresh but they said that they only par cook each waffle and then finish it off back in the iron when one is ordered.  Fair enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "When we got the waffle it was piping hot and the smell was glorious.  In hindsight I would have asked them to forego the powdered sugar on top b/c I think it made the outside of the waffle slightly soggy.  Inside the waffle, it was steaming hot, soft and doughy, I could taste and feel the crystalized pearl sugar in my mouth and it was wonderful.  I only wish I did not get the powdered sugar because it was missing the golden brown toasty outside layer.  \n",
            "\n",
            "While eating my waffle, I noticed that Saus serves poutine!  Even though I was getting very full and my husband advised me against it, I ordered a regular size.  The fries were great but the clear winner was the gravy.  It was clearly homemade gravy with the stock cooked down for a long time with a chock full of flavor.  That gravy is ridiculously good.  The cheese curds could use a little work though.  The cheese were not melty because the pieces were too big so we were biting down on large, cold cheese pieces with hot yummy gravy all around it.  It would have been nice if the curds were smaller so that it would melt better and provide even distribution of cheesey, gravy goodness all over the fries. \n",
            "\n",
            "All in all, I would definitely go back for the waffle (sans powdered sugar) and the poutine (cuz not too many places in boston serves it).\n",

We got pizza and it took a long time for it to get to us, even though the place was next to empty. We sat at the bar and the guy helping us was funny and amiable. Only draw back is that it is a cash only place and it takes about a half hour to get your food from when you order it.\n",

Also they have nice soup bases\n",

            "First time at this location, I was impressed with my dining experience. I have been to Roaring Fork downtown a couple of times, service had always been flawless and the food always met my expectations. This time around, I decided to order the bacon wrapped pork loin, it was delicious. I also got to sample the Dr. Pepper ribs and the Filet, Dr. Pepper Ribs were a bit dry i am going to, could not really taste the Dr. Pepper in the sauce... but I guess there are 23 flavors in there somewhere? Filet had a nice woodfire taste, my friend ordered it medium rare, it was a bit overcooked to a medium rare plus - medium in my books.... but not enough to complain or send food back. I would definitely like to return to this location to see the view off the patio, it was too dark outside to see anything, but from the way the dining room is set up, seems to be a nice view (all facades being large windows followed by a dining patio area).\n",
            "Good food, but too cramped.  Service was very attentive and accomidating with the menu.\n",
            "Super friendly service no matter what time of day.  Pastries are fresh and locally sourced.  Coffee is deep roasted and not for the faint of heart.  When I am in a tea mood nothing is better than that Assam Golden Tip.\n",
            "We wanted to spend some time in the Disney area with our family. We stayed at a 3 Bedroom villa overlooking the pools. We had plenty of room for everyone and my 10 and 8 year old girls loved having some space to themselves. The pool stays pretty loud even late at night, but the noise did not keep us awake. The resort is so close to everything Disney, and is really convenient for the Orlando Airport, and The Universal Parks and Wet n Wild, too.\n",
            "This iHop is ALWAYS packed, always. Although, this is my first choice iHop to visit, I am not sure why its always packed. It does not matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. I have been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcon's hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager did not even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezy's ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifa's baby's momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - \"Hi, I Am AmberRose and I will be your server today...\" All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left \"OH, OK!\" and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she would have given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you do not, you have to go see for yourself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Besides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when I am ignored by my waiter but I did not even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it did not even phase me.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. I am really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I do not care if they are country or city. I want them out of a she will. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and they will bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. \n",

            "Ate here last night based on recommendation from friend. Order the Oaxaca burger and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were enjoyable and I like the portions. The burgers are not huge, so depending on appetite you may want a second. Agree with other Yelper reviews.\n",
            "There was great food but the service in the beginning was questionable. We were about to put our order in and was stopped short by the cashier to serve a woman who was not on line. It was not appreciated and when questioned, we were asked to wait. The other cashier was very nice and helpful but they were out of many items because we had arrived close to their closing time. \n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately the server who arrived with our food continued to hand the plates to my son-in-law and he almost burned himself because of no warning of the hot plates and because the server was too lazy to put them on the table himself. \n",

            "Overall, I would recommend because the food we did receive was awesome.\n",
            "I planned a work event here on a Saturday evening for 10 people and chose Eclectic initially because they were the only spot to accept reservations on a Saturday in the city. After the experience though, I am surprised they are not popping at all times.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our server was attentive and really knowledgeable of the menu and the food was awesome. I had the seasonal ravioli that were really flavorful and had lots of great vegetables in there. My coworkers had the salmon, several sides, chicken snitzel, quinoa, and a host of drinks. We would definitely return and recommend others to try this place out!\n",
            "Pretty solid food truck. I tried the Chicken Torta. I definitely want to go back and try the Carne Asada. The dude working was very pleasant and made my order very quickly. I would definitely recommend this place.\n",
            "Quality donuts due to it is unique flavors. Was told by folks who lived in Portland to skip Voodoo and just go here. I ended up going to both and there is a distinct difference. It is much more bougie option at Blue Star and it is a place if you want to treat yourself a bit.\n",

            "It is located where the concession stand was at the marina.  The counter gals were friendly and took our order.  As I was chatting with the gals (which all of the staff was friendly and VERY accommodating) they gave me a postcard flyer where I noticed they had entertainment there.  Being that I was there on a Holiday weekend - of course I asked about it.  Come to find out the owner, Patt, was on America's got talent.  So I saw Patt (who was very hands on working in the shop) and asked if we would be getting a show.  He said he would see what he could do...  about 15 minutes later (as we were sitting outside on the picnic tables looking over the water, enjoying our amazing hand tossed pizza) Jay Schuurman (which I found out is one of the partners who moved from California for this!) put on a little demonstration of pizza tossing!  WOW!! Then Patt came out and show us how to really toss a pizza - while it is on fire!!\n",
            "\n",
            "My friend's family came on ordered the cheese pizza.  I needed a little meat and dove into a selection I created - sausage, banana peppers and mushrooms.  They have quite a few \"house\" specialty pizzas and I will be going back and trying some of them!\n",

            "Only thing is - I could see going a little heavier on toppings...  but the sauce and crust are great!\n",
            "I used to come here frequently when I would find my way downtown.  As the years passed PDX got more and more food options and I simply forgot about this place.  In the last six months or so I remembered it again and I am glad I did.  I do not think anything has changed in the last 10 years.  The same older gentlemen greats you at the door and treats you like long lost family.  The food is very good and reasonably priced.  The gf and I always share the appetizer platter with one dinner and this seems to give you the most variety for your buck.  Not a huge fan of the salad or the vegetables (canned) but the lamb options and gyro are fantastic.\n",

Nothing really against those two but... let us be honest, if you like a good cup of coffee, there are far better options. One of those options is the Coffee Bar in Gastown. They serve 49th Parallel coffee and it is fairly evident upon first sip that it is a notch above the norm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gastown is already a hip area but the space here is half the appeal. Lots of windows and natural light. The ambience in this place is one that is cool and high end. It does not have the character that a Matchstick Coffee would have but the coffee is great in its own right. A great place to stop by if you are in Gastown and in search for a good cup of brew.\n",

            "What is on point: We shared a cheese plate and a charcuterie plate and it was a great snack to have before getting on the plane. Their small plates are very well done. The smoked salmon was wonderful. The waitstaff was very friendly, and knowledgeable. Multiple people waited on us, and they were all very nice.\n",

We enjoyed the wings the simple burger and I do not recommend it being cooked well done... and we both shared the pull pork platter. We said the burger was over cooked and they took it off the bill no problem. John was the manager that night and was helpful. Thank you\n",
            "Nice service. The Cuban sandwich is my favorite, but I do not think they offer it everyday. The Reubens are also very good; they go heavy on the sauerkraut, which I approve of. I have also had some random smoked ham/Swiss sandwich which was delicious. This place is a little pricey, but I have found all the ingredients to be high-quality.\n",
            "Delicious! Laid back atmosphere. Great place for a quick bite to eat or a drink before a movie\n",
            "I like this place.  It is no Houston Vietnamese joint but what, in Austin, is?  I have yet to find a place as good as Houston Vietnamese offerings (they do not ever get the lettuce wrap egg-rolls right.  Green leaf lettuce, people!  Give me my pickled daikon and carrots with fresh mint and cilantro too please!!!  Austin Vietnamese places always serve up ice-berg lettuce if they give you any at all- BOO!! and plain old fish sauce with no chili or shredded carrots), that said- this place is good.  Nice pho, decent egg rolls, decent vermicelli, friendly staff.  My only other petty complaint is that when the place is empty, they will sit you right next to the one occupied table and these tables are pretty crammed in together.  This has happened more than once.  In a busy restaurant, this is okay, in a dead-quiet restaurant, I prefer a little more privacy.   We asked to move to another table and that was no problem, but a little more fore-sight would be nice.\n",
            "The wait for an open table was not long. This place is notorious for poor service because the waitstaff is not experienced taking high volume.\n",

            "Excellent baked goods and good vegan food but pricey. $8.00 for a grilled cheese. OUCH! BUT, my carnivore husband said it tastes just like a grilled cheese sandwich which is a huge compliment! The FLT (vegan BLT) was pretty good though the bacon was a bit on the salty side and started to irritate my mouth but the cinnamon roll and blueberry scone afterwards cured that problem right away. They offer a selection of teas that I enjoyed with my baked goods. Perfect for a cold day.  Overall good place and happy to see a vegan restaurant. I like how \"vegan\" is not blasted in the decor as you walk in. Cannot wait to see how they grow in the future! Bravo!\n",
            "Went there today and got the CHICKEN KABOB WRAP & DOLMAS (grape leaves) both were very good. The dolmas was a bit to much on the lemon side and I expected it stuffed with meat.. but overall it was good. I paid about $14 for everything. When I left I brought BAKLAVA (walnut) always a fave... cannot go wrong with this pastry!\n",

I mean, I knew on some level that Grub Hub would bring me anything I wanted, but I never allowed myself to investigate the ramifications - and Wings Over has a (slightly) lower delivery fee.\n",

A couple of them, I refused to try (I am a wuss), but the Honey BBQ and Teriyaki were both really good.  I put Wimpy sauce on the garlic parm wings, and it was awesome.  (Yes, I know I could try hot garlic wings, but they would not have the cheese.  Seriously, try this.  It is completely delicious.)  I wish there were a buffalo garlic parm option.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I liked the ketchup.  This is weird because (1) I am not generally a fan of ketchup, and (2) Does not everyone just use Heinz?  I am left with the conclusion that there is something about the garlic Parmesan waffle fries that makes them especially tasty with ketchup.  I loved the fries, and like that there are five options.\n",

I do not count a salad that is mostly made of croutons and cheese, with Caesar dressing.  It would be nice to be able to get a garden salad, or... I do not know.  Corn on the cob?  Green beans?  Broccoli?  Just a thought.  And there are no desserts (at least, not on the take-out menu).  If I am going to stuff myself with things I should not be eating, I could use a cookie or something when I am done.\n",

We headed over there on a Friday night, and thankfully managed to miss the large crowds. It is a little odd the way it is set up... walk in, stand in line, have a guy hand you a number and tell you he is going to reserve a spot for you, wait in line to order, and then go find your spot. While we were in line we had a waitress come up to get drinks for us which was nice. \n",

They make their buns in house which makes them tender and fluffy. And a bonus, you can buy a 6 (or maybe it was an 8 pack) pack of day old buns for $1.99. \n",

            "I was actually surprised at how good the tour was. Very informative. Whether you go into it a complete novice or you are a chocolate expert, you will pick up some good information on how chocolate is made. Before you go on the tour you have an opportunity to buy some chocolate made onsite. The place also has a very competent cafe and my girlfriend and I ordered a couple of sandwiches prior to the tour. The food was very good. The tour seemed to last a good half hour or so. You are stepped through the chocolate making process beginning with the growing of cacao trees. There are also some nice historical factoids you will learn. The highlight of the tour is at the end when you get to sample many different chocolates ranging across the spectrum of cacao content--from milk chocolate to dark chocolate. And each sample offers interesting flavor hints such as vanilla and chili pepper, to name a few. The tour guide was top notch. You could tell she loved her job. She was very engaged. If you purchase a tour you receive a discount on everything in the gift shop that day. I think this is a nice place to visit for an hour or two if you have any level of interest in chocolate.\n",

            "I used to work near here and would come here AT LEAST 3x a week for a quick and tasty meal. I swear my mercury levels are off the charts. I am basic and always ordered a salmon don or the tuna/salmon combo. These are the most boring things ever, but it was SO GOOD. The salmon pieces are so thick and fresh, and they sprinkle the donburi rice with some fish flake things. Their fish to rice ratio is spot on too. They do not load up the nigiri or fill up the dons with an overwhelming amount of rice. I would come here during my half hour lunch breaks and the wait for my food would be ~15 minutes during the lunch rush. Sometimes I would come after the lunch rush knowing there would be less people and my food would come out pretty fast, like 5 minutes. Totally worth.\n",

            "I am no BBQ expert, but I have enjoyed the ribs and perhaps its noteworthy that they Buffalo Chicken Fingers are very good. Nice big pieces of chicken in a hotter than average sauce.  Good service and self serve drink station.  Use the Gemini Parkway exit to get here quicker.\n",
            "Went to Rally Pizza for the first time & had a great dinner. The space is perfect for large groups, but incredibly loud. Staff was okay, not super friendly. The menu is pretty hipster, lot's of great options for salads, booze shakes & small plates. The pizza list is actually pretty limited. I ordered the Tocca di Verde pizza & a butterscotch milkshake. The milkshake was perfect for the hot day & the flavor of butterscotch came through perfectly. The pizza was also amazing; the dough, ricotta & chile/garlic oil were delicious & unique flavors. Overall, the food was fantastic, but the environment was hectic & noisy. Cannot wait to come back & try more of their pizzas + salads, but might order to-go instead.\n",

            "I checked this place out on Yelp, and the reviews were generally pretty good, so I decided to try it out. My buddy and I went there on a Tuesday night for burgers and beers. I ordered my burger medium, with cheddar and bacon, BBQ on the side (the only way to have it). It came out quick, and perfectly done along with FF and onion rings. The place is definitely a townie bar, but sometimes that may be the type of atmosphere you are looking for. The food was good, the Sam Summer on tap was good, and everything was cheap. $35 (not including tip) for 5 beers and two burgers is a pretty good deal. The bartender was friendly and attentive. I will most likely go back.\n",
            "Fantastic!  Smiling, pleasant and  knowlegeable staff.  Excellent fresh tasting food.  Several great bottles of wine for less than $50, which is great because I am usually a bit snobby with wine. Get the meatballs, zuccini flowers and mozz stuffed crocette!  Pasta is all homeade and delicious.  Will def be back next time I visit Boston.\n",
            "Yum! I adore gelato and calling \"chocolate chip\" by its Italian name, stracciatella, just makes it even better. My fiance and I had lunch at Antico- his first visit and he was lukewarm or a little plus to our capriccioso (sp?) pizza- mushrooms, artichoke hearts, a kind of ham/prosciutto I forget, and one of the creamier mozz (eep, again forget the name), which is one of their white pizzas. I guess I am kind of cross-reviewing here, but I do not have enough to say to update my Antico one - maybe just bottom line we would have ordered a different pizza.\n",

            "The whole caffe setting is really cute, and they definitely have the classic \"Set up\" for the bins of ice cream in the case pegged just like in Italy. I had to go with my fave flavor and it was delicious, from texture to size of chips, to creaminess. He got the cappuccino, and thought it was equally good. At $6 for the larger size ($5 for smaller), it is pretty typical of prices in the area (like the yummy soft serve at Yeah Burger).\n",

            "Service at Chipotle has been fine, no major problems here. I have been greeted upon arrival, and attended to immediately. The Daryl Hannah doppelganger (as previously mentioned) is almost worth the cost of the trip alone, she also makes a mean burrito! I did have some trouble understanding the person who built my burrito the last time I was there though. He did have a thick accent, but usually that is not a problem for me, he just needed to speak up, as I had to ask him to repeat himself several times.\n",
            "\n",
            "To me, the burrito is the main attraction of Chipotle. So far I have tried the Chicken, Steak, and Barbacoa meat filling, and thus far the Chicken is my favorite. I thought the Steak did not have a lot of flavor, and the Barbacoa was tasty, but a bit too spicy for my liking. You can choose your own filling including rice, beans (black or pinto), salsa, cheese, and sour cream. Their mild salsa is a pico de gallo (salsa fresca) and its basically chopped tomato, onion, and cilantro. I did try the hot salsa, but it was a little too hot for my tastes. They have other options such as tacos, salads, a burrito bowl (the entire burrito filling served in a bowl with no tortilla). For vegetarians they do also offer a veggie burrito with guacamole.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chipotle's value may vary by customer. $6.25 for a chicken burrito is moderate, I know there are cheaper places, but none of them are less than a mile from where I work. I have had about 4-5 burritos there now, and they have been fairly consistent, but some of the employees make better ones than others (see: Daryl Hannah). Beyond that I do not think there is much value. Nothing comes with the burritos, so if you want chips & salsa, they charge $2.05. Granted, you do not technically need them with a burrito, they do help make it a meal. For fountain soda, it is another $1.90, so overall you are not getting out of there for less than ten dollars, which is expensive for a lunch.\n",
            "\n",
            "I do not understand why there are so many negative comments about the atmosphere. Upon walking in the place has a nice modern/minimalist décor with a little Mexican culture thrown in here. This in comparison to the gaudy furnishings of some of some other restaurants, it is nice. Besides, I do not go to a restaurant to judge the art on the walls or the tiles on the floor. I would like to point out how much I love the music though. Most likely it is being pumped in from some satellite station, but kudos to whoever chose the station. One minute I am hearing Radiohead, the next a bluegrass cover of Pink Floyd. For the most part the restaurant has been as clean as one can expect, both in the dining room and in the restroom, and the staff is presentable as well. They have an enclosed area to eat outdoors, which is a great option for those nice Massachusetts days.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location is decent, formerly a Henry's Root Beer Stand (sadly, a failed endeavor) and prior to that most likely a bank or something, Chipotle is trying to capitalize on a great location on a busy road just down the street from several large office buildings, but in a really inconvenient spot. Taking a right out of that parking lot is hard enough; do not even think about trying to bang a left. The parking lot is small, but I have never seen it packed there, so unless they start giving food away I do not think this will be a problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall I have been very pleased with Chipotle, and I will continue to visit. My only major complaint is the value/price, if they added a combo where you could get a burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink for like $8, I would be ecstatic.\n",
            "So this is one of those situations where I made the mistake of reading Yelp reviews and listening to the naysayers before checking a new place out. I have been to Duffy's twice, and each time I did not expect much going in, because friends from South Florida and other Yelpers kept saying how the food was no good here. However, each time I was pleasantly surprised by not only the food quality, but the service in this loud, hectic sports bar.\n",
            "\n",
            "To start, this place is MASSIVE! They took over the space that Krave once occupied, and I do not remember Krave being that big. There are tv's everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE. So this place is loud. But it is set up so you can watch multiple games from your seat with no trouble at all. \n",
            "\n",
            "The bar features a selection of 2 for 1 cocktails, and a decent selection of beer. On my first visit, we sat in the bar and ordered drinks and apps. This was one of their first days open, and it was packed. We had to be across town and did not have a lot of time, and yeah, I was skeptical. Our server was quick and our food came out fast and hot. The mozzarella sticks are beer battered and tasty. The calamari features some peppers that give it a kicked up flavor. We also enjoyed the chips with salsa and guacamole. We were on the road in time to get to our next stop with no problems, with full bellies!\n",

            "My second visit was with some friends for dinner on a Thursday evening. Again, it was crowded with the Thursday night football crowd, so loud and happening.

This is where I finally face the disappointment!\" as my food did not look like anything special. But then when I bit into the sandwich I was impressed. It did not look like much, but it had great flavor, and I was super happy with my order. I did sneak a bite of the lobster mac n cheese a friend ordered, and that was tasty as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I guess the lesson today is not to always listen to Yelp (unless you are reading my reviews, then trust away!) and give a place a fair shot before making a judgment. You just might find something special!\n",

I liked that the restaurant had booths and that the benches were padded. The food was nicely displayed. Good-sized portions. The food was really good it tasted fresh. The waitress came by several times to check on us and see if we need anything. The bill was reasonable.  Great place for an evening meal.\n",

Nice selection of dishes, with pictures to help you with your selection. My Gyro plate was ready in seconds and came with lots of tasty gyro meat, a meatball, rice, salad, pita bread - it was almost too much to eat. All the food was great,  perhaps a little on the salty side - but not so much that I would hold it against them. My lunch, with ice tea, was just short of $13 - which I am beginning to learn is about average for lunch downtown. I will definitely go back!!\n",
            "I have been to the Sunday lunch buffet a number of times - it is tasty and much lighter than either Diva or Namaskar across the street. The choice for vegetarians is somewhat limited (3 out of 6) but the momos, lentil soup and salad make up for that. Perhaps more disappointing is that the Sunday menu does not seem to change which makes it a bit boring after a few visits. \n",

My boyfriend got the carrot cake french toast, which was insanely rich and sweet and... I wish you could order just one slice so that I could get one of those *and* something savory.  The only gripe I have is that I ordered hot chocolate and there were little powdery bits that had not dissolved all the way and it tasted like it was Swiss Miss or something, which I do not necessarily have issues with when I pay $3.00 for a giant tin of it.

I was wiling to be accommodating and have them modify a dish on the menu. The server said he would speak to the chef and let me know. A few minutes later the chef appears next to our seats.

            "I finally made it to Veracruz All Natural. My verdict - the migas TOTALLY deserve all the hype. Tied for #1 for me amongst Austin migas. What makes these migas so good are the house made corn tortillas - both the chewy/crisp chips cooked in with the eggs and other ingredients and the fresh tortilla wrapped around the hot, tasty ingredients. (As an aside, these migas share a trait with my other favorites at Cocina de Consuela. Both cook the chips to just the right consistency, kind of al dente, like you would find in chilaquiles, which are a close cousin of migas). Of course, it also helps that the tacos are freshly cooked to order, a fundamental to any good taco.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like any good migas, these do not really need salsa because the salsa's all included inside - jalapenos, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. Nevertheless, I had to try all 3 salsas and they were good. For you Taco Deli fans, Veracruz's green salsa is basically the same as La Dona. My wife concurred on the excellence of the migas. I also had a taco al pastor. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, especially in the shadow of the migas.\n",

Veracruz is about 20 minutes from my house but it is definitely going to be a regular destination from now on.\n",

            "\n",
            "Our order arrived fairly quickly and the Dynamite roll was spiced just right unlike some other places where the roll can be too spicy or garlicky. The highlight of the meal was really the Volcano roll which was a California roll topped with crab and crawfish sauteed in a spicy mayo sauce. Delicious!\n",
            "\n",
            "My second visit there was for lunch. I met a colleague there and we both had the bento boxes which is a really good value and very attractively arranged to boot. I ordered my Shaken Beef bento box with the mango/crabmeat rice roll which was fresh and tangy and just the right level of sweet. My colleeague's Mixed sushi bento box was just as appetizing. \n",

            "Hit this place up for a date night last night. The aesthetics were phenomenal. This is an extremely striking bar both from the road and from inside. Our Bartender(Dustin, I think? I should have written it down) was extremely personable and knowledgeable. The craft cocktails on draft were absolutely delicious. Also, you can get a \"flight\" of two cocktails for $14, just in case you cannot decide which one to try. The food was hit or miss. The chicken torta was fantastic, the smoked chicken was moist and delicious and the slaw rocked. The french fries were also great. \n",
            "\n",
            "My wife's brisket sandwich was just okay. The brisket itself was a bit dry (for fairness, it was from the lean end of the brisket). However, once the chipotle mayo worked its way into the brisket, it was pretty good. I would have been disappointed to get just that cut. The queso was also just okay. It was just a bit one note with no real spice to speak of. A little pico or even a hot sauce/spicy bbq sauce drizzle would have helped break up the monotony. \n",
            "\n",
            "*Edited for accuracy* The draft beer selection was... confusing? Not bad, but the draft options from the breweries listed in the below comment (thank you for the correction) were a bit on the safe side.

            "I can see why this is rated as a top brunch spot! I was leaving Vancouver and wanted a solid meal before I went. Medina cafe had some of the tastiest sounded items on their menu, and the hype about their waffles was a treat that lured me to coming. It was quite busy on the Sunday when I arrived. Even a seat for one at the bar was about a 20 minute wait, so get here early if you are a big group!\n",

            "I ordered their Le Complet (Flatiron Steak, 2 Sunny Eggs, Caramelized Onion & Piquillo Goat Cheese Crostini, Romesco & Seasonal Greens) for $19: SO WORTH IT! Their juice was fresh, and I would get it again. But their waffle in my opinion was only ok. It is $3.25 for a single waffle, and if you want a topping (I ordered salted caramel), that is another $1. I did not find it to be anything special. All in all, the variety in their menu would keep me coming back. Would love to try something else from Medina the next time I am back!\n",
            "When I was in Buckhead I ate here about four times and it was so good. I would go back in a second to this place.  Had great adult beverages also.  You do spend some money but you do not come out thinking you overpaid.  God I wish I reviewed when I was down there.  Get out and eat people!!\n",
            "Hudson Grille gets an extra star from me for being better than the Taco Mac across the street. Let us do a side by side comparison:\n",
            "\n",
            "1 - Our service at Hudson Grille was fabulous. Anyone who can handle a 15-person table with the ease that our server did gets major props from me. He was knowledgeable about the menu and beverages, including their specials. Food and drinks were delivered promptly. At the end of the meal, our receipt was split up by seat. TMac - You must practically trip your server a la the Budweiser \"Too Hard\" commercial to get their attention.\n",
            "\n",
            "2 - Food was tastier than expected. Nowadays when you grab a burger at a sports bar, you do not expect much. I am not saying my burger was as good as the burgers at Five Guys, but I am saying it was better than most places. The meat was actually cooked to order, and they even offer a wheat bun. I ordered the sweet potato fries which I am 100% sure came out of the frozen food section at Publix (-1 star) but they tossed it in some cinnamon to somewhat make it their own. TMac - you only eat there because you are there for the beer or game or both. The food is mass-produced and while it is not disgusting, it is just... average. \n",
            "\n",
            "3 - I was impressed by the drinks. Look, I am not one to get frou-frou drinks at a sports bar, but our server recommended the vanilla godiva martini as the $5 special that night. I tried it at it was DELICIOUS. Whether there was not much alcohol in it to begin with, or you just could not taste it, I do not know. Highly recommend you try it out. Beer pitchers were priced the cheapest I have seen in Midtown, AND they came with 6 wings. Needless to say, we had multiple pitchers. TMac - The only drink you should ever get at TMac is the beer. It is their specialty. You cannot beat their selection, but based on all other points (size, cost, time from ordering to receiving) Hudson Grille wins.\n",
            "\n",
            "4 - Hudson Grille has complimentary valet right at the door. TMac - does not. How about you pay to park in a nearby lot or better yet, find street parking? Fun.\n",
            "\n",
            "5 - Hudson Grille just feels classy, for a sports bar. Maybe it is because it is new. Whatever the reason, you will not feel dirty going here. It is almost as if HG is for those who have graduated and moved on from Taco Mac. TMac - all sorts of people will be here, including plenty of creepers and those just off the street. That is their game though - I prefer to feel elite at Hudson Grille.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some other things:\n",
            "- Trivia was fun but (the game, the game host) needs to be improved.\n",
            "- They were able to accommodate our large group.\n",
            "- I looked for dessert, but did not see it on the main menu or drink menu. Everyone wants a brownie or cheesecake after a pitcher of beer. Where were they? \n",
            "- Manager came around to check on our table. I really appreciate seeing that, just in case I happen to need a napkin at *that moment*. \n",
            "- Although I say HG is classy (#5), it is teetering on the line of  pretentious. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now that I have been here, I know I will definitely be coming back!\n",
            "I had the Fish it was very good. Really liked this place. Our waiter was fun and offered a ton of suggestions. Large menu and a lot of TV's everywhere you look you can find a tv. Great location.\n",
            "I actually ate here a while back with the lady. We had an excellent prefix dinner. Service was great-very friendly staff. No Cointreu at the time for a Corpse Reviver No. 2-no big deal. It is cash only, but they have an ATM inside. Will def be back!\n",
            "Wildwood is known for their mussels, and they were truly amazing -- massive, juicy, flavorful, just perfect all around.  I am not going to lie to you, they were the best mussels I have had in years, and I would make the trip back just for a whiff of that sweet steamy broth.  And, as a huge bonus, they come as an appetizer which is almost sized like an entree -- very generous portions for $13.\n",
            "\n",
            "The focus on ingredients really comes through, both in the menu and the flavors themselves.  The green salad with toasted hazelnuts and currants was top-notch, as was the bean soup.  The Strawberry Mountain New York strip ($34) was good -- but it did not need to be quite so smothered in blue cheese butter.  The caramelized onion tart on the side did not really bring the entree together -- but still, a great piece of meat.\n",
            "\n",
            "Quiet but pleasant decor in the dining area -- try and score a high booth for more privacy, or sit outside if it is nice.  Service was great -- well timed, good advice, very professional.  I almost gave Wildwood five stars... but I have decided I need to hold out a little more with that score -- the meal was very good, but not extraordinary.  But I would definitely go back.\n",
            "I went here for a meeting and was introduced to the super incredible happy hour at the bar. . which runs from 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM (ooh. or maybe it was from 5 PM. . .) with some awesome five dollar appetizer specials. . . innncluding: very crab laden crab dip, mini iceberg wedge bites (yes, they were adorable), and petite filet sandwiches. I have not been to this location for dinner, but definitely in other cities and am sure that many a business or celebratory meal is had in the dark interior over some tasty red meat!\n",
            "Use to go all the time. The cilantro sauce calls my nameee! So good and delicious reminds me of some places i use to eat in miami. So good soooo good :))\n",
            "It took me forever to tackle Meat & Bread, but I finally did so today!\n",
            "\n",
            "So, has this place lived up to the hype? Yes and no. \n",
            "Their daily special today was a butter chicken sandwich with pea shoots and sauces. Was not bad, but I had my eyes set on the other creations people have been bragging about. \n",
            "\n",
            "The workers and guests are friendly although I did not feel as 'hip' as the majority of them. Prices are fairly competitive with pub grub, but the quality and flavours are worth every penny.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would love to come back to see what other tasty innovations they can put together in freshly baked bread.. with meat. See what I did there? Zing!\n",
            "White Spot is usually my go-to place for dinner if I have been shopping around the mall. The wait is never that bad but it does vary (around 2-10min for the times that I have gone). The employees and manager are very friendly and welcoming when you enter the restaurant. I have gotten the Tuscan Chicken Pasta before and it comes with garlic bread on the side for around $15. Although it might be a little more on the pricey side of usual dishes, the portions for this specific pasta is pretty big. Other dishes I have tried have all tasted great as well. The service is pretty good, like I said before, but the only downside is that I find it a little hard to get the waitresses' attention when asking for the bill etc. Maybe it is the way the restaurant layout is or the waitresses are just really busy during the dinner hours. Overall, I recommend this place; great dishes and good service.\n",
            "The name of this restaurant is completely deceiving .... This is a full on Vietnamese restaurant !! A good friend told me about the bánh mì (Vietnamese sandwiches) here was \"really good !!\". I have only ever said that the BEST bánh mì around was at Ba Le on Main street (at the beginning of chinatown). \n",
            "So off to Surrey we go... I asked my friend why the name was Golden Pizza, as that seemed kind of weird for a Vietnamese restaurant. He did not know for sure but heard they saved money by taking over an old pizzeria and saving money by not changing the name.....lol. Anyhow, the food was very good !\n",
            "Ordered the Pho dac biet (combination pho; rare beef, tripe, meatballs, brisket, and tendon....yum !!!) ,ch giò (spring rolls) and a couple bánh mì.  The broth was smooth and savory without being too strong. Did not feel like it was super loaded with MESSAGE either. The noodles were perfect, not too mushy, almost just al dente. The ch giò was crispy and nicely cooked. Not the best I have every had but decent. The bánh mì was a great surprise though, I would almost rate it as good as Ba Le. I was super happy to have found another place to get my fix when I need it !! The fresh baguette was crispy from toasting in the pizza oven that was still in the kitchen. The meats were flavorful and tasty, and all the veggies were crisp and fresh. \n",
            "My experience was so good there I even ordered take out for later. I cannot remember what I ordered but it was the a rice dish with pork (their top seller) was very tasty, but I am sure it would have been better fresh. \n",
            "A definite place to try out if your are a vietnamese food fan!! I know of friends that drive from Coquitlam to go there when they are craving Vietnamese. The prices are reasonable and the service was very friendly. A typical family run establishment that uses their children as slave labor........LOL.\n",
            "Great, fun seafood shack type place in Boston - especially with friends, lots and lots of friends! Look, this is not the city fine dining place. Order apps and crab plates and drinks and put them in the middle of the table and have at it Everything was pretty good.. I lost track of the $ so I am not sure if the value is strong, but it was not ridiculous.\n",
            "I really REALLY like this place. There is no particular reason why it excels above and beyond other bars, but here are a few fine points to mention:\n",
            "\n",
            "1) Old school Star Wars plastic lunchboxes serve as the condiment carriers. \n",
            "2) A stellar music playlist.\n",
            "3) $1 beers. All. the. time. Their Old Fourth Ward ale is not bad (just a typical domestic light lager), and at $4 a pitcher (yes, not a special-- it is this price all of the time) it becomes extremely tasty.\n",
            "4) Diverse clientele: a lot of hipsters, but many old regulars (and by old I mean double Ivan S' age old) and other locals.\n",
            "5) Friendly, fast service. Our guy tonight was Sam and he was charming, quick, and always there when we needed him. Three cheers for Sam! \n",
            "6) They had a side dish called a \"meatball boat,\" and it is just that: three delicious meatballs covered in cheese and served on a plate. What could be better?\n",
            "\n",
            "And if those 6 points do not get you in on their own, they have got a pretty fun trivia night. Mondays host general knowledge at 8pm followed by a round of cartoon trivia at 10. Thursdays have adult trivia at 10, which I can only imagine would be tons of fun. \n",
            "\n",
            "I am hoping to move in to the very close vicinity, but even if not, you can bet a $4 pitcher that I will be back here. Soon.\n",
            "This is one of my go-to places for quick Thai in the Broadway area.\n",
            "Their curries are really good.  I have ordered the yellow curry and red curry the most respectively.  More often than not the potatoes and pumpkins are not quite cooked enough - they are too hard and chewy.  I suppose I have gotten used to it in time.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had the Pad Thai yesterday for the first time and did not like it at all.  It lacked flavour and heat.  My advice would be to stick to the curries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Counter stuff are always friendly and the food never takes more than 10 minutes to come out.  There is a water dispenser and cups for customers to help themselves as well as a variety of curry packages, sauces and desserts that you can buy to go.  I have had good luck with the packages as well - just warm up on the stovetop, add some potatoes and protein and you have got an easy meal.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lunch specials are a good deal at $8-10 and curries for dinner(excluding rice) are in the $10-$12 range.  Note they used to offer a discount if you showed them your Yelp - I received 10% off.  As of Oct, 2016 this appears to be defunct...\n",

I must have not gotten the memo on this one, but for the life of me, I do not see what the Fun is in all this Queso Fundido around town.  A big hunk of melted cheese spackled over some meat does not scream fun to me.  Now Torchy's is the sauce version (hence no Fundido) and blending in some green chilis along with their diablo sauce does the trick here.  I wish this stuff came out of the soda fountain.\n",

            "Damn, if they would let me alter this tomatillo salsa at all, I would politely decline.  I routinely substitute it for the 'recommended salsa' on several of the taco's and I even pony up the extra dough to get a container of it to go.\n",

The fish is great and at the right price.  This is not top tier sushi, which some can tell a difference.  To me though there are three types of sushi; bad/old/cheap sushi (ru-sans, kroger, any all you can eat buffet), then good sushi (Ichiban in alpharetta, Yoi Yoi, Sushi Nami), and then great sushi (Tomo, Umi).  This is the good sushi, the eat once a week sushi, the did not bankrupt me and delicious sushi.

So why do I continue to go to this rather pricy restaurant once or twice a year? It is for the ambiance of the restaurant and for the excellent level of service. The interior is a very comfortable place to be, and the service here has consistently been excellent. It is a pretty romantic setting for any guy looking to take their significant other out on a date. Yes, I could go and cook the food that they serve here on my own, for much less money. But I would also be spending an extra hour prepping and an hour afterwards doing the dishes for a 4 course meal.

            "best. donuts. ever.  and i say that having only tried a few flavors at various farmer's markets (i took my husband to the cambridge winter market specifically for the donuts).  i can only imagine how much more dangerous it would be to go to the store.  :)\n",

            "The best sushi place in the area, my favorite by far. They do a really good all you can eat sushi and kitchen food as well. My fiancé and I just discovered this place the other day and have been twice this week already. Its also a lot cheaper doing the all you can eat if you can get at least 3/4 rolls. The paradise roll is awesome also my favorite. The servers never let us down so far with bringing out refills on drinks and bringing out the food hot and fresh. I have already recommend this place to most of my friends . We are looking forward to our next date night .\n",
            "Delicious lattes, their roasted beans taste so good added flavor is unnecessary. Very reasonable prices for a coffee as well.\n",
            "I love this place!  Yes, it is kitchy- yes, it is touristy, yes, it is in Titusville, but despite (and to a certain extent, because of) all that, it is a fun place to get a relatively inexpensive meal of high-quality seafood.  No, it are not the cheapest thing on I-95. No, it are not got 25 varities of sandwiches and BBQed stuff.  No, it are not Wings & Things.  That is what is good about it!  Hell, even the locals pack it full every Sunday just after church.  Git you some of them rock shrimp.  If you do not like  them fried, git  them grilled.  If you do not like  them bland, git  them spiced up with some Old Bay or some Jerk.  If you do not like shrimp, git a steak.  For one thing, Titusville does not exactly have a ton of options, but I am so happy that it has this one- I will go quite a ways out of my way to eat here.  5 stars.\n",
            "I have never been to any restaurant with such fast service. Food was fresh, accurate and tasted great.  Drinks were spot on.  The place is a little loud so not a place to linger. We had the ceviche to start.  EXCELLENT, so fresh.  I highly recommend the burritos served on greens.  My table mates all said their chimichungas, tacos and fish burritos were some of the freshest they have ever had, top notch ingredients.\n",
            "How do you do 6 stars?  You have to try it.  Every aspect of brunch here was great!!!  It was a long wait but that comes with a great dining experience in a prime location.  Try the strawberry pancakes!\n",
            "Amazing food. Waitress Adrienne really knew the menu, and helped my friend and I navigate the gluten free side. Having celiacs it is hard to trust restaurants, this one has a GF kitchen! Love. Love. Love. Would definitely come again. The Melt burger was out of this world.\n",
            "The service was great.  The food was excellent.  I ordered the Minestrone soup and the Canneloni al Panna.  It was delicious.  We went Saturday evening.  The restaurant got crowded very quickly.  So making a reservation is a good idea.\n",
            "I first visited Ristorante Olivio for a friend's rehearsal dinner two summers ago. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff very attentive to the RH dinner guests. Recently returned for brunch (which I did not even know they served) and had a lovely frittata with fresh veggies, a side of savory butternut squash and fresh squeezed juice. YUM.\n",

            "One of the better quick pizza places on campus, in my opinion. If you are looking for cheap, hot (seriously, scorching hot) pizza, this is your place. Grease levels are not quite as bad as Catfish Biff's, and they do not do anything too special - cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms are the toppings - but the crust is my favorite around here and the slices are big.\n",

            "I got delivery on a Saturday night. They were on-time, the delivery guys was pleasant, and the food was hot. Had a house full of recently immigrated Italians and they could not stop saying how great the pizza was! They said it could compete in Italy. Even the smell convinces you that the ingredients are high quality.\n",
            "This place is by far my favorite spot on the east side to go to for a relaxed few hours with friends or with my man. We always have a great time because the energy here is fun, whether there are a lot of people or just a few, it is comfortable the same. The beer list is the big draw for me because i cannot find such a unique and extensive list at many spots. The people who work here are so knowledgeable about all of their beers. I was able to say which beer i had had, not even one on tap, and they made me a perfect recommendation. Amazing. So much respect and desire to get on their level! Not to mention the food is great. I have had the tomato soup dip with croissant grilled cheese that was literally the best tasting thing of the month. And their desserts are on point. \n",

            "We discovered this place a year ago and it is the only place we get pizza now. The ingredients are fresh and they taste of quality. Orlando does not have a wide variety of great pizza places that are clean as well and I hate all the chain pizza places. But, Flippers puts out a good pizza and apps too! The boneless wings are awesome.\n",
            "Delicious new boba place in Orlando! I ordered the 3Q with 50% sugar, they actually uses real tea here instead of powder. The egg pudding and boba in my drink added just enough sweetness. I love boba places that let me choose the amount of sugar I want. I was able to take a sip of their grapefruit pulps, and it was great! It reminded me of my favorite boba shop back in Singapore. I also got to try to peach jelly, and that was great as well. I love the tea flavors in all those drinks because they were strong enough to taste. I cannot wait to come back to Orlando for more.\n",
            "I really like their chef specialities..the basil chicken is very nice. They do not skimp on the basil.. yum. They have nice basic chinese food plates with good flavor.  I have not tried their vietnamese food yet. Always a place to sit at dinner..Most everybody gets take out food or delivery . I give this place the extra star because after 2 years of not eating here the owner remembered us.. and was happy to see us. That is hospitality.  Overall. They have quite decent food for a reasonable price... and you do not have to suffer through the loud indecency(meaning it is so damn loud you cannot hear the person you are with) of a chain like p.f. chang' since they are off the beaten path. Check them out if you are in north austin though.\n",

With such a positive vibe and great attitude he made our experience over the top. \n",

            "Edit: We went for a second time a few nights ago and had a different waiter. It completely changed our experience from something that was \"the best I have ever had\" to \"it was good.\" Our waiter this second time was nice and polite but was no different than service we would get at some place like olive garden. He very much went through \"the motions of serving.\" \n",

            "Best Japanese fare in the county!  They have a very extensive menu and everything I have had is great.  The sushi is fresh and artful, prices are reasonable and the dining area is comfortable.  Also, it is always a good sign when you see several Japanese people choosing to dine here as well....\n",
            "Always amazing food! I eat here all the time and usually get the soup or calzone and occasionally the cheesesteak. I took my parents and sister who live near Philly and they loved it too! We had John and he is an awesome server. He convinced us to get the brownie cheesecake and it was fabulous. I highly recommend it. Ask for John!\n",
            "Finally had a chance to try their food and it was absolutely delicious! The sauces is what makes the whole meal complete! It was my first time coming here and the gentlemen who was working at the counter was a very helpful. Definitely coming back here for more!\n",

            "\n",
            "The male (Latino?) cashier was extremely congenial, helpful, and just overall pleasant. The food was fairly prompt and delicious! I would come back just for the tacos and the service, not to mention the refreshments.\n",

            "Party of 11 with no reservations, seated us in a few minutes and had the dinner of our lives. Everything was delicious, cleaned every plate we had. Service was exceptional and catered to our every need, the atmosphere was great after a day in Universal.\n",
            "This is one of the few places on my top 5 default food choices for lunch. They have some really great New York style Brats, Dogs, and Sandwiches. They are extremely friendly and proud of their food. Caring about the customers is evident, and keeps people coming back feeling like a regular.  It is not your typical food cart, or restaurant  tucked into what appears to be a garage. But do not let that deter you, you would be missing out on one of the best cooked sausages this side of the city.\n",
            "Outstanding food and attentive wait staff. Enjoyed the seafood pasta would come back for sure\n",
            "So, let me start off by saying...this place is packed, I mean packed all the time! Always lines out the door!  When you come inside, or make it into the door if you are lucky you are instantly transported Ito Mexico.  You know it is good when everyone inside speaks Spanish and is not a tourist.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Took about 20 min to get a table and only because there were only two of us. The menu is extensive and with items I have never seen anywhere. This is no Taco Bell or \"on the border\" people. This is real Mexican food!  Prices are great and food even better.  Stop here and eat, you will not be disappointed!!!\n",
            "Great place for a healthy lunch or dinner. Quick and friendly staff makes it a good staple to the neighborhood.\n",
            "Deee-lish! Groupon got us there but the quality of the food keeps us coming back for more. Their salad bar includes extremely tasty soups, appetizers and salad. We tend to fill up on the salad bar and end up taking the actual entree home. It fills up quick at lunchtime so it is best to go at 1-ish. \n",
            "\n",
            "The prices are reasonable and the entree portions are good. As I noted before, their soups are very tasty. Go. Enjoy.\n",
            "We went on Saturday for lunch. The service was so friendly and so fast. I had the wonton soup which was delicious. Boyfriend has the house pho and he loved it. Good prices and good portions. Will definitely return!\n",
            "This place has been a regular visit of mine since the first day I ate there. I fell in love with their grilled shredded pork and noodles in the B1! Great business, great people and of course great food!\n",
            "I went here the other day and ordered \"The independent\" and I was impressed. The Barbacoa and avocado went perfectly together. Love the service and fun environment\n",
            "Damn they just do everything right! I have tried most of everything they have, and it is all perfect. The meat is perfection, the buns are soft but do not fall apart, the spreads are kind of magic! Plus everyone who works there is really sweet!\n",
            "This restaurant was recommended by a Boston native we met on the street. Holy cow is the food amazing. My friend had the SoCal chicken burger which she said was the best chicken burger she would ever had. I had the steak tips and clam chowder both of them were fantastic. Our server Darren was also great as was all the staff we encountered. On top of that the location is awesome.\n",
            "I went here twice; first time was later in the afternoon and they were sold out of almost everything.  Apparently, everything comes in fresh each day and when they are out of food they close (KUDOS!!).  The second day I came back earlier and had the beef meatball Pho.  The broth was clear (as it should be) quite tasty and perfectly seasoned.  I wish I was in town another day to try the chicken Pho.  Definitely recommend this place, great price, service and especially food.\n",
            "This place is a revelation, as was the salted caramel liege waffle. I suspect this place does one heck of a bang up business with the night crowd but a few of us hardworking cohorts went at lunch to sample their wares, thanks to Groupon.   Luckily for us, it was not crowded but I hope this means they get do a bang up business later.  They must stay around for  a long time. \n",
            "\n",
            "The four us, salivating at the thought of the menu alone, ordered one order of fries (With bacon parm and curry ketchup dipping sauces), one large poutine, one salted caramel waffle and one homemade nutella waffle. It was the perfect amount for 4 hungry women and there was not much left when we were done. The big hits were the salted caramel waffle (leftover fries dipped in leftover caramel is from heaven) and the poutine. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you have heard of poutine and thought \"Fries, gravy and cheese curds? No way Jose!\" then you need to rethink your stance because it was every bit as delish as we were hoping for. If you do not though, more for us so that is ok. \n",

            "We LOVE LOVE LOVE Ristorante Serena. We have been twice now in the 5 months living in Melrose and have left so content. Our first visit was with family and we had a decent size group but got a table right away. Adiel was our waiter and dessert chef! He was so accommodating to make a drink that he did not have on the regular cocktail menu. I died and went to heaven over the lasagna. My family is biggg on Italian and everyone was impressed. My brother is an avid dessert gastroexperimenter and Adiel was kind enough to share his advices and recipe for the chocolate dessert we had. \n",

I love that this place is a mom and pop style kind of feel. The staff feels like family and the food is home cooked! It is always busy but never takes long to get seated and food always comes out quickly too.\n",
            "I love this place!  They are so friendly and attentive and the food is spectacular.  It is also very well priced.  I have been going here since day one and have been waiting patiently to find them on Yelp so I could rave about it!  Please go and support these people- they are doing an amazing thing over there!  And in the summer I am hoping that they will be able to use the patio; they did a great job making it look appealing but are waiting on permits from the city to use.  GO Masa!!!\n",
            "I came here on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Austin.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the idea of Indian cuisine in Texas,  it he was absolutely right about the quality of the food.  I had vegetable samosas as an appetizer with a really interesting (not particularly Indian) cocktail involving crushed ice, grapefruit-infused vodka and jalapeño.  Dinner was one of the house specialties, lamb Roganjosh, rice, and garlic naan.  The portions were quite generous, and could easily have been split between two people.  I was too stuffed for dessert, but hope to get back again sometime soon.\n",

            "We chose the house wine pairing for an additional 25 dollara which was well paired with the food. I hope to return soon as the chefs state the menu is generally completely different about every 4 weeks. This was a unique dining experience worth the price.\n",

The steak tips at Champions practically melt in your mouth, are of super high quality, have an amazing taste, and come in huge portions.

            "\n",
            "The prices are extremely decent, especially considering the amount of food you get. The beers are average-priced, which is fine with me. Everything is cooked to perfection, and you can tell it is all homemade. I know I am all over the place here, but that is because Champions is like a tasty punch in the face. I almost do not want to post this because I want to keep this delicious gem to myself.\n",
            "Came here for lunch. I had the mushroom ravioli which rivaled any pasta I have had in any good italian restaurant. The mushrooms were fresh and abundant.

Nice first impression (we would never been to CBC before)!! A table was ready for us within 30 seconds and we were seated. The CBC Bloody Mary was really good- they have another 4 or 5 varieties with various other touches. HUEVOS RANCHEROS - do it, please. The dish was fantastic. Waffles were also really good- lots of fruit and what appeared to be homemade whipped cream. Service was excellent. Hit this place up.\n",
            "We love this place. Simple, easy, and so delicious! I always for the carnitas! But my husband eats many of the others and loves them all. It can get busy but the line moves quick, food comes out pretty fast and tables turnover quite readily.\n",
            "The pizza here was fast and delicious, and the toppings selection was awesome! I like the restaurant theming, too. Prices are a bit high, but not that bad, considering how close it is to Disney World. Perfect for a fast dinner after a busy day at the parks!\n",

I was very impressed when Lawrence remembered my preference for English Breakfast in my London Fog - from an order I placed a week ago!  Their dessert selection is small but is freshly baked from a local baker each day.  The dome mango mousse has become our favorite at RFC.  Its light creamy texture is the perfect complement to a cup of London Fog.  And yes, they brew a good cup of coffee.  No complaints from the coffee drinkers.\n",

The combination was heavenly and the service was friendly as only a Boston bunch can be. When I am home visiting family I will definitely be looking these guys up!\n",

            "Came in last night to celebrate a friends birthday and we were immediately greeted by Nancy, i asked her to make the birthday girl a fun drink and she came up with this awesome painkiller tiki cocktail, it was sooo good. She also brought out a dessert with a candle on it  as a surprise for my friend it was such a great gesture. We will definitely be back!\n",
            "I am so glad that Sage has opened a new location in Buckhead.  It is easily one of my new favorite restaurants in the area.  I just went to the Perimeter location last week so I knew what to expect but this location really steps up the bar up to the next level.  The décor is really swanky and sexy and the food is really delicious BUT the kudos go out to the Management (Rafial) and Mixologists/Service Staff (Michaeal & Seth).  I am a stickler for good customer service and this staff really gets that the patrons are most valuable in keeping a restaurant alive.  They are super friendly and dedicated to making sure your experience is superior to that of its competitors, so for that alone I will be back.  \n",

            "But let us get to the drink and dining experience.  Michael recommended I try a premium craft cocktail that he had created and boy am I glad I did.  He created a blueberry, lemon cocktail that was light and refreshing.  It was not too sweet or overpowered by liquor, which makes for a really great drink. It was a perfect blend of flavors bursting from every sip.  As for food, I ordered the Seafood Frutti Di Mare, which is jam packed with all kinds of seafood faves: Muscles, Calamari, Scallops, Shrimp, and Fish (Daily Catch).  All the seafood is a top of Linguini and Tomato sauce and when mixed together you get a seafood medley to die for.  \n",

I have seen her at other jazz spots across town so I was pleasantly surprised to see her work again.  She is really a delightful musician/pianist and I hope they put her on a regular schedule...she is that good.  \n",

            "Love this restaurant.  Have been there 20+ times over the last 3 years and 2 locations.  They added a sushi bar, more things for other people to eat (not me).  I am very impressed with their curry dishes and Pad Thai and all their appetizers.  But the essential item on the menu is Tom Yum soup, extra hot when I have a runny nose.  Best natural cure for common cold symptoms I have ever had.  \n",

My friend was all over that deal once she saw it on the sign outside the window. I did not feel like working for my food so I ordered the lobster roll entree which came with fries and coleslaw. My friend raved about how delicious her lobster was. The lobster roll I had was awesome! I loved it! Chunks and chunks of lobster meat. The fries and coleslaw were delicious as well. I cleared everything off my plate! We went during lunch time so there was not much of a crowd. The waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. I am kind of glad we discovered this restaurant on our last day in Boston because we could have been eating lobster every single day all day and all night with that lobster deal. They are giving it away!!!\n",
            "Exceptional service, fantastic food, comfortable interior, and a great value! We went on a weekday night for dinner with another couple and were very pleased with everything.

The Tilikum (fried chicken) and brisket special flavor profiles were on point! St Johns was perfect for the no meat eater in your group. Goat cheese and seasoning on the portobello make it special.

            "Our go-to locale while we are in Florida on winter holiday. Very centrally located. You can arrange Town Car pick-up and drop-off from MCO (Orlando Intl) via the front desk/concierge.  My hubby and I find this hotel and location convenient while visiting relatives near Tampa (we rent a car for a day from the Hertz desk at the adjacent Hilton); and east coast attractions are not too far away as well. Needless to say, Epcot and Downtown Disney access is super quick due to the hotel's location. There is also a bus that shows up about ever half hour to bring you to Downtown Disney, Epcot, Magic Kingdom, etc. Now to the specific amenities: the rooms have superb beds (think high thread count sheets; goose/feather down pillows and light comforters; stylish black and white cotton coverlets). Nice baths (frameless glass showers; bathrobes and slippers). Decent breakfast (room service): was only late a few minutes one day. Nespresso machines in room. Nice place for breakfast downstairs. The Bull and Bear steakhouse has pretty decent steak (compared to Vegas and NYC). After two stays - I have declared this hotel my Florida hotel; feels very comfortable and familiar. The staff is excellent. Looking forward to the next visit in early 2014.\n",
            "Chipotle is the Mexican word for: \"your poo will come out smoothly tonight.\" I just love how quick and delicious their food is. A tiny bit pricey but it is super delicious. I like their full menu for beer and drinks too. And being open until 10pm makes it a no-brainer. Excellent establishment overall.\n",

            "We went for drinks and appetizers and really liked it. There is complimentary parking which is nice because otherwise there is limited street parking. There is a covered patio with seating, inside seating, and bar seating. The ambiance is super casual, and there are TVs all around playing different games. \n",
            "We sat at the bar and Rocky was our bartender. He was super nice and personable! For drinks we got the Zombie, The sangria, and the Genesee Cream Ale. All of them were really good and I really loved the beer (always on the lookout for new beer lol). We also go the Cheese Dip & Salsa which was really good! \n",

            "Delicious food! Brussel.sprouts and apple jam were so good. Tomato salad too. My friend BJORN from youtube sent me here and he knows what is good and what is not. He said the food here 5 stars. Soo good. He was right.\n",

The first day we went, we stopped at the coffee bar for some lattes and were Atwater rather quickly after! Our coffees were brought to us and once we made our order, our food arrived rather quickly for how busy they were. I was so happy with the menu. Where I live, there are not many options for vegetarian breakfast (or any food for that matter)\n",

            "The food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I have never had a bad experience with the sashimi I have ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\n",
            "\n",
            "The service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I have had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you have never tried before.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.\n",
            "Accidentally, my comment regarding Sushi Saki's dangerously warm sushi was posted on accident to Mikado Ryotei reviews.  Please do go to the Mikado Ryotei restaurant because shortly after the accidental post was read by the owner, the owner was immediately concerned and alerted me to the fact there may be a mix-up in the names of the establishments.  If the owner, Mark W., is this conscientious about the information placed on a public site regarding the quality of his food and service.  I believe it is fair to say, he is concerned about his compliance with food safety and food quality.  Thank you again to the owner for catching this simple mistake.  I will go to his restaurant next time, never again to Sushi Saki.  Thank you.\n",

            "I love Minero! The queso fundido is decadent and I constantly crave the wings, which are served in a paper bag with Valentina hot sauce. All of the tacos are really good but my absolute favorite dish is the veggie burrito, which is a large, shareable size. The guacamole is perfect and the house margaritas are nicely done. Minero has consistently great food, a wonderful staff and great service.\n",
            "Excellent!!! Everything was Great. Just a little annoyed I missed Happy Hour by 5 minutes. He could have told me to wait. Who starts Happy Hour at 4:00? Overall, very happy. \n",

            "Really enjoyed the happy hour tacos and mole dish. Great flavor on both. - especially the pork.  The drinks were as I would expect, but good price on happy hour. Server was above average and had a great vibe. She offer water for our dog, which was much appreciated. The chili rellenos was out of this world, so much flavor with right about of veggies, spice and quinoa. \n",

If there is one thing that I can emphasize about this review, it is that everything about every dish tasted so fresh and delicious, and that is why we will be returning.  The mint that was used in our dishes was so pungent and tasty, there was no greasy residue on our food, and we left the meal feeling satisfied and not gross.  Our waitress, Grace, was very cheery and informative, as we had many questions about the menu.  We also got a side of the pork belly buns and the short rib tacos.  The pork buns were un-freaking-real, so tasty.  My one gripe about the tacos were that they were served on soft corn tortillas, which really took away a lot of the flavor of the beef.\n",
            "For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse, the chocolate nib cake, and the coconut pie, all of which were very good and flavorful.  We really could not complain about a thing, even the price which was really quite reasonable seeing as we ate our faces off.  We will be returning very, very soon.\n",
            "This place was exactly what I was looking for today.  Fresh, great tasting Mexican food, at a fair price.  The avocado salsa was excellent, and the menu was nice and simple.  I will usually choose Mexican food over any other, and I am glad I chose this place today!\n",
            "I do not know what else to say about this place, the food, the staff, the atmosphere, the music... Other than You got it!!! This place is amazing! I had the fried oysters for a small plate and I could have had about 5 more orders. I did not want it to end. Seriously, they have a very lite coating, the flavors just burst in your mouth.  Wow! Then as my entrée, I went with the Arugula and beet salad and got Salmon with it for my protein. Not only was it beautiful, but again Chef, you did it again!! Really surprised this place is inside of a Radisson Hotel. One of the best hotels I have stayed in In a long time too!! Clean and comfortable as well! Five Stars\n",
            "I could not rave enough about my experience. The food was great as always but it was really the staff that made the experience 5 stars. A friend I was with was feeling ill while we were waiting in line (she has a blood sugar condition which sometimes causes her to faint). A bartender noticed she was not feeling well and offered her water, a place to sit, a cool towel and ice. Multiple other employees offered assistance and checked up on my friend throughout our meal even when we were seated. As a restaurant employee myself, whenever I dine at other restaurants I pay close attention to the staff. I was overly impressed. I wanted to thank you all for caring for my friend and going above and beyond. I will definitely be back!\n",
            "Baraonda is a great place to dine before seeing a show at the Fox Theater. I always enjoy dinners at Baraonda. Good service, wine is a little pricey at $11/ a glass, but at par with other midtown restaurants. I like the carpaccio, my friend enjoyed the lasagna. They have a nice (albeit small) patio. They are busy before a show, so make a reservation well in advance. Service is faster if you sit at the bar.\n",

            "In additional, among the dozens of other Vietnamese restaurant in Vancouver,  I like that this one as it is a more  of family oriented restaurant and willing to welcome anyone who walks through their doors.  \n",

            "Only drawback is that I have noticed that they did however increase the price ,   but so has everything else in the neighborhood.\n",
            "Not the best wings I have ever had but very very good.  The dumplings are excellent as are the garlic noodles.  Wish every restaurant was as casual, fast,  and delicious as this.  Hands down the best food i have had in Oregon.\n",
            "All I can say is wowwwww. Had the best Haitian meal in a long time. I strongly recommend the lambi. Ohhhhhh also ask for the Haitian Explosion. Yesssss and the black rice. Ohhhhhhhh I forgot the Macaroni salad also. I need to come back. To bad they are so far from home. I will still be back\n",

            "Most recently we have been going to the Brookline Village location. It is still small and intimate but has a bit more room and obviously not impossible parking. I went with my wife and daughter and we were all pleased with our food. The have both family style dining (long tables) and booths. The decor just like the SE location has a very Cocina Latino feel to it with painted wood and Venezuelan art.\n",
            "\n",
            "We ordered the Reina Pepiada (chicken salad)  arepa and the Fried yucca as an appetizer. They both come with this amazing lime sauce that I cannot get enough of. The Arepa is challenging to eat because the chicken and avacado kind of squishes out but the taste is worth a little mess.\n",
            "\n",
            "For our entrees I ordered the panela-crusted mahi mahi which was served over a spicy beef. It was a strange combo I thought but worked very well. My daughter had the Adobo Smoked Tenderloin Churrasco and she raved about it.  My wife had the Polvorosa De Pollo (which she always gets) and she enjoyed it.  We did not order drinks this visit, but for the record they make one of the best Mojitos I have ever had and Negro Modelo always goes good with latin food. ON other visit I have ordered the Tuna and it is flavorful and rare and awesome.\n",
            "\n",
            "The waitstaff was cheery and friendly and I alway love their Arepa Girl/Boy T-shirts. We went on a Saturday night and even though it was quite busy we only waited for about 20 minutes.\n",

            "Service was fantastic!!\n",
            "Very affordable (entrees under $7) but *SO* delicious. The food was very authentic and as high quality as some of the swankier Mexican places I have been. I got the flautas: three chicken flautas topped with cheese and guacamole on a bed of lettuce, served with rice & beans. So good. I will definitely be returning here on future trips to the Orlando area. Be aware, they do charge (less than $2) for chips & salsa. That said, my husband and I both got entrees, I got a sweet tea, and we split chips & salsa, and we still made it out for less than $17 (pre-tip). \n",

            "Fresh and innovative cuisine....  These guys have never disappointed my friends and I with their inventive flavor combinations.  They have sauces and desserts down to a fine art.  And even if your a meat/dairy eater, the dishes here can satisfy without use of imitation animal crap.  Try the grilled tempeh sandwich or collard green fajitas, and you will see what I mean.  And in the dessert category, try the carob date brownies.  Prices are great for what you get, as well.  The only complaint I can see first-timers having is that the service and food wait are a bit slow.\n",
            "My husband and I ventured to Tucci's on one child-free, winter night to hang out with friends from his work. At first glance, the restaurant seems small, or maybe it seemed that way since it was completely packed with people....on a weeknight. I quickly took a mental note of the large outdoor patio that looks like it would make for a nice outing for a Summer night. \n",

            "Overall the atmosphere is great - dark and relaxing - and romantic if the occasion commands. However, for someone like me who hardly gets away from the demands of a child going through the terrible twos - this is what I would call a \"grownup night on the town.\" Especially after seeing the martini menu. I am not much for fruity or strong drinks - much more of a beer girl... And then I was introduced to the \"Flirtini\" - a pink little glass of girlie heaven...after about five of these reasonable priced martinis...I was feeling pretty good and ready for dinner. Not being extremely hungry, I had ordered the Beef Carpaccio and small salad - all which were beautifully presented and very delicious. To end the night - of course I had to try the ultimate chocolate martini - which was awesome! \n",

            "Finally got to try Pho Oregon & it was absolutely magical! Got to the restaurant a little after noon & it was packed. Advice: if you just do not like dining in a loud restaurant (or if you are hungover), I suggest you take out. This restaurant is ridiculously loud. Everyone in the restaurant was talking over each other & I literally had to shout at my fiancé for him to hear me.\n",

This is the first pho restaurant I have been to in Oregon where they actually have the sauce cups, spoons & chopsticks on the table (which is completely normal back home in Hawaii - everything you need is on your table). Their sambal & jalapenos plus other utensils were on a table next to the counter, pretty much a help yourself table. \n",

I really enjoyed the fish/vinegar sauce it was served with. The pho was amazeballs - broth was piping hot & sooo flavorful. The meat was good, especially the brisket. It was a PERFECT, soup to noodle to meat ratio. And if you see the small Pho before you order & think it is way too small for you - it is not. The bowl is completely deceiving & they give a PERFECT amount. Also their house satay is no joke, it was spicy & oh soo good! \n",

After not having anything from here for months, I finally ordered some boneless wings and fries to be delivered to my apartment today. I was pleasantly surprised that the fries were not horribly soggy when they got here, as they usually are when I get take-out. The boneless wings were smaller than usual, but you buy by weight, not number, so I was alright with that.\n",
            "THE PERFECT EXPERIENCE! Sunday brunch is our favorite thing to do in Austin. We heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to try it. When we got there at 11, it was an hour and a half wait, but with their awesome new outside patio, we could have waited even longer. The bartender, Lauren, was knowledgable, sweet, and inviting and if the bar offered the entire menu, we would have stayed outside with her. Their bloody Mary's and Fire and Ice were amazing because of their delicious infused vodka. After our wait (which flew by), we had carrot cake French toast and the steak and migas Benedict with Jeshua (who was friendly and very accommodating), and both meals were to die for. My favorite thing about this place though was the extreme level of customer service. Every single person was happy to be at work and friendly. I have never had such a good customer service experience. Cannot wait to go back.\n",
            "WOW !!!  I would give this place SIX STARS!!!  Fridays in Lent are no penance if you can enjoy their blackened Haddock a REAL mash!  And be sure to get a cream doughnut or cream filled eclair with chocolate. Oh, and do have a nice cup of tea.\n",

            "Great subs. Fresh turkey, ham, roast beef. Solid chicken cutlet too. I have eaten here a 100 times.\n",
            "This place is amazing. The pizza is off the charts and tastes like real Italian pizza (and was extremely well-priced). Also the staff was friendly and service was quick.\n",
            "This is one of our favorite local restaurants. Casual but nice ambiance (renovated a few years ago) with absolutely delicious food. Our favorites are the Greek salad, falafel, lasagna, and fries! There are also several very healthy Mediterranean dishes that we have enjoyed. The servers also seem to really enjoy their work and are always pleasant. We usually go for dinner, but I imagine it is a popular lunch spot too. Hidden gem in Toco Hills.\n",
            "Best patio in Seminole County! We love to go and hang out with some great food and live music! The steak salad with their amazing blue cheese dressing is always a go to! Wings or Blackened Mahi Sandwich are some other great options! And the drinks are always GREAT prices and even better pours!\n",
            "Outstanding Middle Eastern grub. Fresh every day (falafel made to order), super clean and fair prices. I can recommend the falafel, hummous, baba ganoush, tabouli and swarma. Do not miss the green hot sauce. The gyros are good but a little dry and not the meatloaf texture you may be used to (which I oddly prefer).\n",

YES- there are jellyfish swimming behind the bartender. Open kitchen always makes for a very cool experience. After I got my margarita buzz on and my belly was full of tasty treats, one of the chefs was happily humming as my date and I were wrapping up dessert and I suddenly felt I had travelled to a South American kitchen, or maybe it was the fantastic live acoustic guitarist.... The waterfront location is accessible, and sets up for a nice spontaneous stroll after dinner. I consider this my new *hot date* go-to spot.\n",

This was at 4:20 p.m. No traffic tie up yet, and was there in five minutes, gave my order to the sweetest girl at the register. Great smile. She was very helpful as I was not familiar with their menu. Was in and out in less than five minutes. She loved how I wear my hair. Will definitely be going back, as all the employees there were doing a great job, and , working in a restaurant as I do, enjoy making their customers satisfied so they will return.

            "This is not one of those restaurants that you go to to get something unique for breakfast. This is somewhere you go if you want a nice predictable breakfast :-) which is exactly what we wanted! And good old-fashioned egg's Benedict, biscuits and gravy, sometimes a breakfast joint can get a little too creative. Thankfully Valerie's does not.\n",

            "I give this 5 stars for a few reasons.\n",
            "1.  The location - Living on the north shore, it is so nice to NOT have to drive all the way home from Boston or Cambridge after a good dinner.  Until now, there has not really been any restaurant worth while in the area.  If you are from the city - or any other city in the YOU.S., you will be fine with the location.  If you are from suburban hell and have a lawn, you will probably be freaked out because occasionally someone that does not have a polo shirt or loafers walks by - or you may hear someone that does not have an American accent on the sidewalk (if they happen to be walking by).\n",
            "2.  Food - I have to admit, I went here the first weekend it opened and had a carrot cake slice for dessert.  It was the worst thing I have ever had and to this day, I have never wanted carrot cake again....but that was years ago.  Since then, the place has consistently been exceptional - from the appetizers (they have all been excellent so far) and even the bread and maple butter - omg the maple butter is good enough to have as a meal by itself!!  Lately they have had an applewood smoked steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes that is out of this world.  The salmon is good and you can not leave without the cheesecake dessert!  Everything also has an excellent presentation.\n",
            "3.  Ambience - It is loud, it is happening, things are constantly going on.  The music is excellent - but I only notice that because I listen for it.  You might not even hear it over the crowds.  Staff members are clearin tables, or carrying steaminig meals, or serving drinks.  It is exciting to step off the quiet street into this hive of activity.\n",
            "4.  Service - Service is good.  I have never really had a long wait for anything.  and the bartenders are hot!!!  Despite being so cute, they are very friendly, very knowledgeable and very attentive.  There is one guy and one girl in particular that, when dressed in black, look like they could have played the part of ruling the underworld on Charmed!  They are great and I love sitting at the bar just to see the hustle and bustle in the kitchen and the shakin martinis at the bar!\n",
            "5.  Price - Though I may not have reviewed them yet, I love places like Henriettas table, Craigie on Main, or The West Side Lounge in Cambridge.  Or Orinoco in Boston.  I feel like the Blue Ox is somewhere in that circle of places.  Maybe a little less organic and local (but hey, maybe they will read this and be inspired!).  The lower cost of rent in Lynn, however, allows the Blue Ox to be on the same (or better) playing field as the others - BUT with a lower price!   I love it.\n",
            "Overall - I would say try it!  You will not be disappointed!  You can take the commuter rail up if you like - only 19 minutes from North Station - or you could drive.  The area between the train stop and the restaurant feels like the beginning of something new - the sound of several bands practicing on upper floors of buildings echoes through the street, sometimes artist events are taking place.  Like the restaurant, there is a vibe starting there that is pretty exciting.  If you have a lawn though, you will probably just drive there and park on the well lit street (and have just as good of an experience!)\n",
            "What can I say? We still LOVE this place!  Have eaten at The Gallows four or five times.  Always a positive experience and a delicious meal, with a warm, bistro vibe.  Super-friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff get high marks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their menu has recently been updated.  The seasonal heirloom pumpkin soup was out of this world, as were the mussels.  Tip:  try the crazy new gin martini with pickle juice!!!\n",

            "Service was a bit slower than usual on our most recent visit, but they seemed short staffed.\n",
            "\n",
            "For those of you who recall The Gallows as extremely noisy - which it was - it appears they have attached acoustic panels to the ceiling.  These seem to absorb the sound and the \"din\" has become more \"dim\" and conducive to conversation.  We live in the neighborhood and will keep coming back for more.\n",
            "My wife and I went into the Bing town diner on a Saturday.  When we first walked in there were 16 women sitting at one table it must have been from and they must have been from the auxiliary club.  When we first sat down I was worried about the service but I must say Pam is one of the best waitresses I have ever meet.  Our coffee was hot or breakfast came out in a very timely manner I would recommend to be in town diner to anyone. Again remember to ask for the greatest waitress ever Pam.\n",
            "Wheelhouse is a great little grease joint. Do not go here if you want a lot of space. Do not go if you want healthy food. But if you are willing to squeeze in, you will get the best breakfast in Quincy, possibly anywhere.\n",

            "Overall, I believe that Pizza Oasis provides tremendous value and is my favorite slice in all of Portland.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I live about a mile away from the mad italian. It is a curse and a blessing because of how often we go. We always start off with the wings, usually getting half lemon pepper (my favorite) and half sweet and sour. Seriously, the best wings around here. The lemon pepper is always so super crispy with a good amount and seasoning and the sweet and spicy are just spicy enough. The philly's here are ahhhmaazing. But so is EVERYTHING. We have have gotten everything from alfredo to salads and everything is fresh, and super delicious.\n",
            "Oooh, waffles. The perfect food made better by the Belgians who added little pearl sugar beads. Those surprising little bursts of sweet that would only be better if there was some bacon.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, if you head in at lunch time, they have savoury waffles (the day I went, it was waffles with prosciutto and brie); I imagine that to be like heaven.\n",
            "\n",

            "This place has a great crowd on the weekends. It very lively and has a great bar (inside and outside). They also have live music on Fridays and/or Saturday night. The rooftop is great with a lovely view of the old Buckhead (Buckhead Shops) area. A spot for The Who is Who and the regular Atlanta socialite. I have been here twice and got the ribeye. Needless to say it was delicious.\n",
            "Great place. Very nice waitress. I wish I had gotten her name so I could share it! Food was perfect. 2 of us shared the meatball appetizer and then the Polpette pizza at the suggestion of the waitress - excellent choice! Highly recommended.\n",

            "Salmons were a little small but reported to be good and cooked as ordered.  The pot pie was home made, great crust - not too thick (large - she could not finish it).  I had the filet steak.  It came with spinach and mashed potatoes, I subbed the potatoes for Mac and cheese (warning: the m&c is a little spicy which I really liked). Fillet was cooked exactly as ordered, I joften if not always have trouble getting a steak at the actual temperature I wants.  I give the meal 4 stars. \n",
            "\n",
            "But desert was the best part because we all shared one of each of the desert carrot cake,cheese cake, key lime pie, brownie, mango sorbet.  I had the cheese cake.  It was really good, although they were not clear that the cake is chocolate or I misunderstood.   I do not like chocolate cheese cake (though I like chocolate).  But I ate until I was completely GIL, it was actually good.   The sorbet was my favorite.  None of the desserts were too sweet, all were home made, home made whip cream.  Deserts pushed the rating to 4.5.\n",

            "Best customer service experience ever topped with an excellent steak.  I made reservations the day of and asked for them to make something special for my girlfriend who had just gotten accepted to medical school.  I kid you not, everyone we interacted with, from the hostess to the bus boy to the waiter, knew we were there celebrating the acceptance and even congratulated her for it.  They made her feel incredibly special and happy. The filet mignon I had there was also EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT.  The Chef's congratulatory dessert was beautifully decorated with in-house edible arrangements. absolutely FANTASTIC.\n",

            "1) It is tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids \"HEEY MORE SAHKIIII\". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) I have gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude.

I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) Price is great. It is also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, do not hate when I get my food before you.\n",

Our server Dan was pretty great, told us about the odd menu specials and at the description of the hot honey wings we jumped on in. (Probably the best food choice we have made in forever). It did take a little longer than expected for food to come out but I must say the nirvana afterward it worth it. Not only was the plating beautiful the wings were delicious, crispy and sauced perfectly. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our entrees again took a bit longer than we are used to, I work in a restaurant and am used to fast service so maybe that is what was itching me. Anyhow, both burgers we ordered, the ox and the sin were juicy and delicious, and the herb fries were good as well.\n",

            "Bottom line, we were glad we chose Ox and will be returning.\n",
            "Really tasty! And relatively healthy too. The tortas are terrific, and the bowls too. If you do not like spicy food, ask them to leave the corn (Esquites) off. The bowl is pretty spicy with it. Friendly service. It is a small place and gets crowded...consider take out if you do not have time to wait (take out pick-up window is at the back of the restaurant)\n",
            "The Boy's office in Back Bay is right next to Parish Cafe and he RAAAAVES about the hot cold chicken salad from here. It is his go-to. So finally after one of my company happy hours at the Rattlesnake, we headed to Parish so I could see what all the fuss is about. \n",
            "\n",
            "I concede this salad is BANGING. It is cold chicken over lettuce and hot rice with this sesame-ginger dressing. The perfect combination. (Pro-tip from The Boy: get extra dressing and extra rice.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Onion rings here are on point as well - super crispy and GIANT rings. Portion pictured is just a half basket, more than enough for two. Also the chipotle mayo dipping sauce is bomb. \n",

            "Hat Creek is very good,  I would put their fried pickles above any I have had in town.  Burgers are very good  too.  Great play scape for kids, good selection of draft beers, clean, and friendly service.  Fries could be a little more substantive, but otherwise I am a fan.  Well done HCBC.\n",
            "Had a Panuchos and a Salbute, both with the roast pork. Delicious! The pork was juicy and the pickled onions helped to cut through the richness of the fried tortillas and the pork itself. 2 items and a can of coke = $4.20. Great food and great prices! Highly recommended!\n",
            "Went on a mini vacation in San Marcos. My friend did a little research on where to eat and found this place. With so many good reviews, this place was a must for us, and it did not disappoint! My friend ordered the fish taco. Those were the best fish tacos I have ever had. It crunchy in the outside and tender flaky on the inside. The avocado was fresh and nearly sliced. The sauce that came with it was mayo base hot sauce with a lot of kick to it. Reminds me of sriracha mayo but better. I had the ahi poki. They were very generous with the poki. It even has a side is rice and a cucumber salad, which I did not expect. The cutest carrot cut out of a crab was place on top of the poki with gave the dish it is awesome presentation. Poki was a little bit more on the pricy side for a food truck item but most definitely worth it! I never had poki before so I cannot tell you how authentic it is. It was just really delicious. The poki was marinated in soy sauce, fish eggs, onion...just to name a few ingredients. My other friend has the big kahuna burger. I was too full to try hers but she said it was really good and moist. It had a beef patty and shredded BBQ pork on top from what I can see. It was such a great find for us for eat there because it was good, affordable, and fast! Will definitely come here again when we visit San Marcos to go shopping at the outlet again.\n",
            "Worth the trip, even on a hot summer day. Migas taco was my fav. Cucumber aquas fresa was refreshing a light\n",
            "Excellent. Service outstanding. Attentive and friendly staff meet you and settle you in quickly. They balance the influx of take out orders, walk ins and delivery well. Food was delicious. We had chicken sweet corn soup; BBQ pork and wonton soup; prawn toast, steamed pork wontons; and house special chow mein. All were five stars. Highly recommend.\n",
            "AMAZING! They are always so nice! My husband likes a drink that is not on the menu and they always make it for him without hesitation. The drinks are so good, I have never been disappointed! Chai latte hot or iced is the best around!\n",
            "I cannot say enough good things about the people that work here.  I typically go in for lunch and everyone who works there is wonderful as they always make an effort to remember me and say hello, in particular, Robyn the daytime bartender.  She is fantastic!  She learned my name from day 1 and always makes me feel welcome.  They have some nice menu choices for lunch options and Robyn always makes sure everything comes out great!  Its because of her, I have become a bit of a regular.\n",
            "Ummm YUM! I had the \"You are my Boy Blue\" and added bacon, and the sweet potato waffle fries. 100% spot on. I will be coming back!\n",
            "When you make a reservation, they ask you for your credit card. Some people may be taken aback with this but let me tell you, thru experience , only VERY GOOD & popular restaurants do that. So give them your credit card, do not let that deter you. \n",

            "If you are visiting, this is a MUST visit restaurant.\n",
            "I happened upon this cafe today when I parked on 7th avenue. It is the cutest little spot with a perfect little patio area for you to sip your coffee. The inside was just as quaint - with two floors and plenty of seating. I ordered a London Fog and it was made perfectly as well. And there was a little square of black chocolate to go with it. I have not had their sweets yet but they all looked amazing. I cannot wait to go back, it is definitely going to be my new haunt.\n",

            "The wait staff gave all the kids activity menus and crayons and brought their food out very quickly (a big plus when you have hungry, antsy kids you are trying to keep in their chair while waiting for dinner).

Hands down best cup of coffee I have ever had. People were very pleasant from a service standpoint. Place looks nice also. I will be back!\n",
            "Best sushi I have had in a long time! Always fresh and plenty of options. The Hana Roll and Altamonte roll are excellent!

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a sushi place!\n",

Steak was moist, tasty. We also had the chicken empanadas... lovely, juicy.  Guacamole was fresh and amazing. Waiter was very attentive. Staff was friendly and checked to as if we were doing ok. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Dang.. actually they need to sell the salsa in the store. I would invest into the company.\n",
            "Excellent, Excellent, SO GREAT!!!! Favorite place to eat in the North End (Boston), have to ask for Mario to take care of you and get the chicken parm....also proof that you do not have to spend $100 to get an excellent bottle of wine.\n",

Portions are large and delicious, especially the Bistek a Cabello.  If you want relaxing atmosphere and casual attire, great service and wonderful food, Que Bueno is a must!\n",

It is literally right around the corner from Revere Beach and it right on the way from Rt 1.    This place hands down has the best quality, quantity and bang for your buck.   The beef itself is adequate - I have had better tasting beefs, but what you pay for and what you get is truely the best value I have seen in beef on the North Shore. \n",
            "\n",
            "Try the Super Beef - its as big as a softball - and they put a middle bun in there between the beefs (like a Big Mac).   I swear this thing is great.  If you are bold, try a Plate - it comes with two slides of whatever you want.  I usually get the fires and slaw and man, is it alot of food - and for under $10 no joke.   They do not call it a plate for nothing, its a serious mountain of food. \n",

            "Amazing.  This place is my new favorite lunch-time spot.  I have had all of the chicken dishes.  I am not normally into really spicy food--the vindhaloo is REALLY spicy--but I could not stop eating it.  There is also a choice of mild and medium spicy chicken dishes, and several vegetable sides.  For the price ($8 or so) and the wait (basically in and out in 3 minutes at noon), it is an excellent option.\n",

The drink selection was good with some nice high gravity selections.  Brussels sprout small plate was tasty app and two off the menu 50/50 burgers hit the spot.  Wait staff was attentive and manager was visible and eager to talk and make sure everything was in order.   Will be back!\n",

There is so much character to the place that I almost imagined myself wearing clothes of a certain era while I ate! We both got Benedict's here. Hubby got Eggs New Orleans and I got the eggs jennefir and a plateful of Beignets with cafe au lait and bloodymary with shrimp. Everything was so flavorful and delicious that I was smacking my lips all day thinking of my breakfast. The waitstaff were fabulous. Friendly, quick and forever watchful they made sure us and our 6 month old had the perfect experience.\n",

After she finished, she wanted to be entertained and our waitress and other patrons were so interactive that she did not want to leave. They have a cute area upstairs with toys for kids that may want to do something else while the family eats. We will keep coming back whenever we are in town and we made sure we got their spice powder coz sometimes we will need to try to create something in our kitchen until we r back in town\n",

            "We started off with calamari and crab dip. Both fresh and equally tasty. We ended up making 2nd orders of each because we ate the first round so quickly. For the entree we all went with the filet mignon. We all requested how we wanted the steak cooked, and they were spot on. Everyone was impressed with the quality of the steak. It was pretty perfect. For dessert they gave us a huge sampler dish. Everything on there was delicious and chocolately and heaven in my mouth. \n",

Extremely large cocktail shrimp possibly 10/12 per lb. cheese dish of blue cheese and a softer cheese similar to a Brie but had a cheddar flavor and it came with a duck chorizo sausage and crispy bread, a couple of us had gazpacho and others had clam chowda. We also had some specialty drinks from the bar. The Oysters were so fresh and tasty. The shrimp a tad to well boiled but still very good. The drinks were reasonably priced. Make it a stop\n",

We wanted to get a margarita pitcher and she recommended the blood orange which was delicious. I ordered the Paella de Oba and oh my was it delicious! The portions are large and well worth the price you pay. There is nothing worse than going to a fancy restaurant and paying 40$ for your plate and still being hungry after eating it. You will NOT experience that here! Every single plate we had on that table was packed full of flavor and was so extremely delicious I will go to Portland just to go to this restaurant. I am praying they open one in Seattle!!\n",

Will definitely make it a must go to place whenever I am in Boston.\n",

I either get the business lunch combo or I get the kufta kabob pita with the greek potatoes. Everything is so great. The food's always hot and seasoned just right.

We were expecting parking challenges and a long wait at this very popular Lake Oswego establishment.  Well, as we pulled in a space opened up. As we entered the restaurant we were among a large number of people.  Two seats opened up at the counter.  No wait.

            "Wow, almost aborted our visit due to the neighborhood feeling a bit unlucky to have a breakfast place we would like but so glad we found Klaus Kaffee! The eggs Benedict was served on a plate that was a slice from antree,, bark and all! And it was delicious! The coffee is excellent and the scrambles supper yummy! Service is finding it is way, super nice but seems like it is a new restaurant. Definitely a place to go!!!!\n",

We had lamb, beef, chicken, lentils, potatoes and a bunch of other things I was not exactly sure what they were, but they were tasty. My body is still warming up to spicy food, so what was a real plus about Asmara was that the dishes were full of wonderful flavors but not overwhelmingly spicy.  \n",

            "\n",
            "They are not up their own asses about their coffee, either. Like, it is one of those upscale coffee places for sure, but nobody's looking down their nose at you.\n",
            "Was looking for a pizza place in Harvard square and stumbled upon the Just Crust. Had a regular pizza and it was fantastic. The exact right amount of everything. More importantly, the staff was so helpful and friendly. Will be back very soon.\n",
            "Farm to table restaurant with an amazing and flavorful menu. We had the braised pork belly, which was tender and seasoned to perfection. It is a small portion though so you may need to get an appetizer as well. \n",
            "\n",
            "We also tried the panko fried oysters from the happy hour menu. Delish!!\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, we had the udon noodles and carbonara. Like an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  You can taste the freshness. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is willing to pay a little more for flavor and quality.\n",
            "I absolutely love Joe's. Not only is it good food, but it is a fantastic atmosphere. I really enjoy their trivia nights, too. Staff is super friendly and fun. They let my group have a debate watching party there when the 2008 elections were going on which was really cool. I cannot wait to go back.\n",
            "I LOVE this restaurant. I came alone and just wanted to have a couple of glasses of wine. Before I left I tried the baked oysters and diver scallop off the Sea Bar menu. The way my server described it, I could not pass it up. Not to mention that she mentioned they were able to try it before they put it on the menu. I should also mention the ambiance is great. With the huge windows that give so much light and the decor, it is the perfect date night restaurant. They have a full service bar although I was more than happy with the bubbles offered on the happy hour menu. When I come back to Portland, I will be back.\n",
            "Here for the first time. I got the wontons for appetizer and the golden beauty for my main. Everything was amazingly delicious; service was beyond amazing. I am thinking my 20% tip is not enough. Lovely place and good vibes. I want to eat here everyday. Non-vegs will not be able to taste a difference except feeling great after a meal. LOVE.\n",
            "My very favorite place in Austin to have Crab Cakes! Happy Hour is great and service has always been upscale even though this is a 'Trendy Dining' restaurant! Love it!\n",
            "Where do I start?  First off, its nice and very clean, good friendly staff, and the owner is most always there and happy to talk with you. They have a very good memory too, so be nice everytime you go there.... start with the Friday soup, or even Sunday. The pork broth on Friday cannot be found anywhere else in portland. It reminds me of the street food soup in thailand. This place is VERY special. It pains me to write this, as I do not want to find the place packed with lame hipsters and uber foodies that always have their noses in the air. I love this place that much. Now this place is very authentic veitnamese, so most all the foods are represented. Focus on the soups, and be sure to get there early for lunch, because the soups WILL run out. Its THAT good. Take a break from Pho, and treat yourself to the best soups you will find in this town. But only go once a month so I can still get a table at my favorite place!\n",
            "Sweet Potato Hash was awesome. Definitely a well family ran chain. Everyone is very friendly and upbeat. Had to wait 20 mins to be seated but...what would you expect from an awesome place! Lots of people go! Keep doing what you are doing! I will definitely be back for more!\n",
            "I usually do not like to dish out the five stars unless it was  the most divine gastronomical experience I have ever had, but looking at the face of a beloved, and dear old friend of mine who I had the pleasure to dine with spoke more words to me than I could have imagined.\n",
            "\n",
            "As an Italian woman who was brought up by her mother's fabulous cooking, my friend knew when something was sublime, and that garlic soup she ordered simply was. Although she does not like to share, for the sake of my birthday meal, she allowed me a sip. Savoring that bit of soup was a truly enjoyable experience. The complexity of the flavor left me wanting more, though that was the end of my whirling experience. Check it out if you are not worried about garlic breath.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a petite person, I can only eat so much, but when the plate of potato gnocchi with short ribs and mushrooms came into view, I knew nothing else but the food that kept disappearing in front of my eyes. The gnocchi pillowy, the ribs melt-in-your-mouth, and the mushrooms as you would have it, I loved every bite of it. Would I eat it again? Sure. Would I order it again? No, but that is only because I want to try every other dish out there!\n",
            "\n",
            "The fiver, however, was seeing my special old lady pal grinning like there is no tomorrow and raving how the soup was something she once had at a Four Seasons long ago that she could never forget. We were left with a business card so she can call and get a take out one day. I left full and moreover pleased that she was pleased.\n",
            "Amazing Peruvian restaurant with great service and food.  Plenty of choices from vegetarian to streak.  Highly recommend!\n",
            "Such a great place. Wonderful decor and amazing views of rocket launches. The food is delicious, and they are always willing to make any accommodations you request. Salsa is great. Staff do a great job. Quick service even with many customers waiting. They seat people quickly and are very efficient and friendly throughout your dining experience. Would recommend you try it!\n",
            "This place is so bomb! I had been regularly getting their food when they had the food cart on 19th and Quimby and I am so happy they finally opened up a restaurant. The chef is amazing and provides top quality, affordable, consistently good food. Keep up the good work! Cheers.\n",
            "The tacos were freaking amazing!!! Omgggg this is the first authentic taco place in Boston that I can find with well seasoned meat, spices, etc. Soooo good. I tried a chicken, carnitas, and shrimp taco. All very good, even the chicken. I usually do not order chicken, but it was actually tender with flavor. The hot sauce was a good amount of spicy (But it is optional). I come here way too often. Lol they should launch a punch card program\n",
            "This is really OKAY and Bueno. Came with my wife from a recommendation of a Columbian colleague. Once in a while she will be experimental on what kind of food she will try. She loved it too! She had the chicken breast with mushroom sauce, rice and salad. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa to get a tour of their food. Excellent meal with enough for two or next day lunch. For dessert we ordered vanilla AND cheese flans to checkout each one, my wife now likes flan and enjoyed the creamy texture if the vanilla flan. Order extra garlic cilantro sauce as it goes great on everything.\n",
            "Love this place!!  The food is really great but it is the atmosphere that keeps us coming back! The live music is very entertaining and you feel like you are having a meal with a very large, extended family!\n",
            "Great decor; not crowded if you arrive around 9:30 on at Saturday; friendly staff; food delivered quickly, and their bacon skillet was delicious.  Already planning to go back again.\n",
            "Please put down the voodoo donut and get in line for blue star. I have been wildly impressed with the growth of the business now everywhere from Los Angeles and in pdx terminal 3. The flavors are so unique and high quality. Granted, you will pay for that- no deal here on donuts you will pay about $3.50 or more per donut. The flavor I usually get is the berry (or pink). Prepare to stand in line about 10-15 minutes. A MUST for tourists in Portland. Really all you need is to eat your way through the city. The flavors here are really interesting- I have seen Mexican hot chocolate flavor as well as lemon ones. Since the ingredients are a bit fancy, I am going to dare to state that if you have kids you might want to go with voodoo as the flavors here are more mature. (Blueberry bourbon, lemon poppyseed, Meyers lemon, marionberry, and orange olive oil) Anyways yes split an interesting one with your SO or friend and you will be glad you did. Do not forget to dip in a blue star coffee to keep you warm in the Portland chill.\n",
            "Oh my gawd this place is too too too awesome.  The coffee is fabulous and the food is too!\n",
            "Ordered pick-up from here and have also eaten in the restaurant.  Service and food quality is always impeccable.  I definitely plan to become a regular.\n",
            "Tonight I have been blown away by how perfectly engineered the Goat Saag was and we almost missed out. I have tried it at other places and hands down this is the BEST because the meat is so tender and melts off the bone. I cannot stress enough how much of an absolute necessity it is to stop by The Clay Pit and get this dish.\n",
            "\n",
            "The staff is incredible and super friendly.  The atmosphere is laid back and fun. My boyfriend and I stopped in later in the evening and just grabbed seats at the bar. Had some wonderful wine and a delicious meal.  Great way to unwind from the day.\n",
            "Chips and salsa are amazing.  They have fish and shrimp tacos.  The building is a old gas station across from Candler Park Market.\n",
            "Glad we tried this place out- it is pretty new and deserves some love! I had the MLK omelette which was delicious and rich and completely satisfying. My companion has the biscuits and gravy- if you do not get a biscuit with your meal, definitely order one with the bacon jam- it is made in house and really good!\n",
            "I love this place at first sight!! The atmosphere is so romantic! The decor is very well thought through, with their original paintingsz\n",

            "This is the second time we have been in and we love it!! This place is great and I felt I had to leave a great review. As soon as we entered a manager helped us with our car seat and gave us a table perfect for the kids we were with. The washrooms are clean and the ambiance in the restaurant is cozy but open. The beer is amazing and the food is FANTASTIC. The food comes out fast and the servers are kind and attentive. Shout out to JASON who helped us tonight. I wish they would open a location in Chicago!!!\n",
            "FAN-TAS-TIC! After a lovely morning snowshoeing on Cypress, we wandered into Mumbai Masala (though it took as a couple of extra blocks to find it - and only then when someone Googled it on their iPhone). Seems 'off-Lonsdale' is actually rather hidden!\n",
            "\n",
            "Nevertheless, worth the search! Although there was no buffet on today, the gentleman offered us Thali (mixed plate), with both vegetarian and meat-eater options. With two curries and a dhal, rice, the freshest naan I have had in awhile, salad, and pakora (? or something like it), it was an absolutely perfect meal. We topped it off the fresh chai.\n",
            "\n",
            "The best part (other than the amazing food - and the eggplant dish was my personal favourite) - only $15 including tax and tip! I want to go snowshoeing again just so we can go here for lunch!\n",
            "I am always happy to get ice cream and ice cream sandwiches at Frozen Hoagies!  Their coconut macaroon cookies are delightfully chewy and brown around the edges, and their ice cream is gooey and delicious!  It is perfectly balanced and not overly sweet.  I have no complaints about Frozen Hoagies!\n",
            "Crazy delicious!!!\n",
            "Now I will be craving lollipop chicken all weekend\n",
            "Go early because they sell out fast\n",
            "I LOVE THIS PLACE! I Have only been once but I will definitely be back. The entire spot is a lounge setting. So you are sitting on couches as if you are at a friends house. Our server was super nice. He was the one to suggest the fried chicken & red velvet waffles. Yes! Red velvet waffles. Everything on my plate was good including the grits & VERY good breakfast potatoes! They even had bottomless mimosas & sangrias! Wait I am not done, once it was around1:00 they had a DJ that played old school R&B & Neo soul. He added a few role school rap songs but it was the fun ones. Nothing crazy. I am telling you if you are in Atlanta you have to try them out!\n",
            "I have been here before also but I brought my parents here for the first time on Friday night.  They LOVED it!  My Mom was raving about the atmosphere and the way the menu was family style.  Dad was suprised it was not that expensive for all you could eat good food.\n",
            "\n",
            "We started with the stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella and tomato salad.  The mushrooms were so good we got another order, the salad was decent but nothing special.\n",
            "\n",
            "We moved on to the baked ziti with sausage and chicken and spinach manicotti.  Both were fantastic.  Chicken Parm and Salmon for the main dishes, both great.  Dessert was Creme Brulee and Tiramisu.  Perfect.  There was 4 of us and one order of each thing gave us each enough to try everything and leave us stuffed.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive and though I drank water like a camel and she filled my glass probably 8 times she did not seem to mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "I made the reservation through Open Table and we were seated right away with no problems.  I will definitely be back with a big group again!\n",

            "This place was amazing. Casual dining featuring fresh food, great drinks, fun atmosphere with very nice servers.  I cannot wait to come back!\n",
            "Best omelet I have ever had! Feta, basil, and tomato cooks slightly runny with a side of yummy bread. It was on the seasonal menu and boy did it taste fresh and local. Delicious ingredients put together with thought. Worth every penny!\n",
            "Great food, great beer for Thursday night football. Huge tv for the game. I will be back\n",
            "Great food and margaritas. The absolute best steak tacos in the city. The Asada steak is always succulent and tender.\n",
            "Once again the sesame asparagus fries were amazing! It was my first time trying the JG Poke and Albacore Tuna Tataki - both of which were delicious. They both might be my new favorites!! The bar tender, Rhia, made the best drinks that I have had here so far - try the Tailspin and Green Tea Drop! As always the Chanel Replica did not disappoint. Our waitress was Joanna - even though she just started, service was impeccable. She also works at Katana. Have not had a bad meal here yet!!\n",
            "I had the most enjoyable brunch today! The bread basket was excellent, with scones and blueberry muffins. For my entree, I had the shrimp and grits, which were amazing and full of flavor. \n",
            "\n",
            "My server Alex was efficient and knowledgeable! By the way the cocktails were great! Make sure you try the basil lemonade.\n",
            "If I could marry a restaurant - this would be it. I do not think there is anything I would change or improve. It is perfection without even trying - effortlessly lovely bartenders, appetizers that have my mouth watering just picturing them, and a lovely atmosphere. Also- the wine is exceptional. Very excited to have Barcelona around the corner from me soon. The only thing I would change would be how often I eat there. Ideally every week (if not every day....).\n",
            "Delicious Breakfast  and unique offerings. I would even say that the breakfast options are elegant. It is hard to go with that description entirely when the cloth napkin on the table is a thin scrap of ruggedly cut country cloth but hey it is Boulder and I am holding it to the standards of Savannah. It is hard not to do as the architecture of Lucille's is so reminiscent of all the great old houses turned into restaurants in Savannah. But that is my bias, I have to get over it, ok moving on.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food at Lucille's deserves the cult following. When I arrived a business attired couple were freaking out about the pancakes and how amazing they were. Grown people in fancy business wear wailing over pancakes was a sight to see.\n",
            "\n",
            "I did not order the pancakes, despite the commotion, I had the Eggs Pontchartrain. Pan fried trout, with a side grits and poached eggs with a bearnaise sauce. I ordered a side of steamed spinach to round out my meal. OMG yum. Crave worthy. Yup add another member to their cult following. \n",
            "\n",
            "The biscuit they served paired so well with their housemade blueberry jam. It was like dessert for my breakfast. So light and perfect. \n",
            "\n",
            "I highly recommend Lucile's. Now thinking about it I find those napkins kind of charming....kind of.. it would have been nice if they were bigger to sop up the mess I made from placing gobs of their delicious jam on the biscuit..ok nevermind the napkins still bother me. LOL but do not let that detour you from going to Lucille's just try not to go overboard on the jam:)\n",
            "This place has some of the best curry for just 5 dollars, and it is pretty generous portions too. My favorites also include the spicy pork burrito, bulgogi taco, and kimchi fries. The spicy pork has a really nice kick to it, the bulgogi beef is by far my favorite taco meat, and the crunch of the fries go perfect with the beef, spicy mayo, and kimchi. The lady at the front is also very sweet and polite.\n",
            "Theo and his wife work together to provide amazing service and delicious food.  I highly recommend the authentic Brazilian cuisine and will return next time I am in town.\n",
            "Love the Lantana Cafe!  Like the first poster said, fresh food well prepared, and reasonable prices.  I often get the mushroom pasta, which is homemade and heavenly; my partner reliably goes for the cod/salmon/swordfish, and is never disappointed.  Now they take credit cards as well!\n",
            "This place is exceptional place to grab a well-made cocktail on the weekends to avoid the hustle and bustle of the typical douche establishments. Pretty Cool place to chill\n",
            "I started working within a block of this place a couple months ago and I am a little embarrassed of how much pizza I have consumed since then. It is always amazing. The crust is light and airy. He staff is friendly. The music is killer. The choices are delectable. Love it! Apparently I am just going to keep gaining weight :-P\n",
            "This place is awesome! Cool location with indoor and outdoor seating. Dog friendly, and quality taps. Came for breakfast through. Menu is interesting and filled with cool takes on your everyday favorites. The presentation was great and the food was INCREDIBLE! Literally cleaned my plate and then my fiancées. Definitely a breakfast highlight.\n",
            "I come from New Mexico and have had trouble satisfying my Mexican food jones. This food just hit the spot. The waitress said yes the 3 changes I wanted in my meal and there was enough food to bring half of it home have for lunch the next day. It reheated very well.  Yum\n",
            "If you are looking for some tofu chigae. COME HERE! Hands down the best place to go if you are craving hot Korean tofu soup. It is always packed but the wait is worth it. I come here often and it has never failed to be delicious. I have tried the surrounding Korean spots but Kaju will always be #1. My regular order is the mild Kimchi Pork Tofu Chigae.\n",
            "I live in Orlando and I heard about the opening of this new restaurant in the Millenia Mall; I wanted to come here so bad since my husband and I are foodies but we had not had a chance.\n",

            "My parents are visiting for the weekend and my mom is a sucker for The Cheesecake Factory.... we were actually heading that way when I thought of Earls and told them to give it a try... in hopes that it would not disappoint us.\n",
            "\n",
            "We got here for a little after lunch time, maybe close to 3.00pm, and it was empty for a new restaurant, but it could have been the day and the hour. They offer valet for $7.00, and even if you do not make use of it -which we did not-, the valet guys were such gentlemen they opened the door for us. \n",
            "\n",
            "We were greeted by two young ladies very excited about our first visit and the girl who sat us told us about the restaurant's concept and the art and decorations, including a full wall art made with Sharpie.\n",
            "\n",
            "The restaurant from my first impression can be described as: Elegant and Upscale. The servers are wearing formal attires and most of the lady servers are in heals (do not really know how they do it). Very clean space and incredible and unique decoration (different colors, tables, lightning, and art).\n",
            "\n",
            "Our server's name was Brooke S, and she was such a sweetheart. She explained that Earls was a Canadian food chain and that the concept was variety... and sure thing you open the menu and you get anything from Japanese to Vietnamese, Indian, American, and more. Prices are decent for the portions you get. \n",
            "One thing I loved was that she brought waters before anything else. That is a great touch, not everybody does it and you always need some water.\n",
            "\n",
            "We order the Tuna Poke with Wonton chips and the Garlic Fries as appetizers... that Tuna Poke IS A MUST! What a delicious twist to a poke! And the wonton chips.... oh my Lord! \n",
            "The fries were good but nothing to rave about.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then we proceeded to order a Chicken Caesar salad, the Half Rack of Ribs with the Cajun Chicken combo that came with potato salad and Cole slaw, and the Chicken Curry.\n",
            "Everything was amazing, from presentation, smells, and taste. I was even impressed with the caesar salad since it is so basic, I was not expecting it to be so good. The ribs were falling of the bone, that potato salad was fresh and crisp, and the curry... simply amazing! It came with jasmine rice and naan bread. It was spicy enough but no overpowering.\n",
            "Of course... at the end of our meal we could not pass on the sweet tooth, and we fell for the coconut cake. That one was a little disappointing, I did not think the coconut was well paired with a lime mousse and strawberries, but it might be just me.\n",
            "\n",
            "At checkout time, the server brought the POS over to us since they do not take the credit card from you and you do the tip and confirm total yourself in front of the server. I know this is a new thing as of 2017 restaurants are not supposed to handle customer credit cards, so it was nice to see it in action.\n",
            "\n",
            "I loved to see the teamwork in this place. We knew who our server was but anybody who walked by us would take dirty plates of the way, ask about out experience, and bring water to the table. \n",
            "\n",
            "All of this being said... we are definitely coming back for more and to try the beverages selection which seems unique and exquisite.\n",
            "Cannot get much better. 1 dinner came a little late so the manager apologized and did not charge at all. Waiter was one of the best I have ever had before. Will be back...\n",
            "Out of every BBQ place I have tried in Austin (including Franklins and La BBQ), this has to be my favorite.  The brisket has a perfect bark with perfectly rendered fat to trap in all the seasoning.   The jalapeno cheddar sausage melts in your mouth, bursting with flavor.  It is been a couple years since we have been, but this is a place you can actually get into w/out a huge wait, which is one reason it tops my list; but it is easily the BBQ that is the major draw and keeps us coming back.\n",
            "Ate here with a group of 6 on a Thursday night. Very casual place. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. Most of us has the Reyes Cuban Sandwich and loved it. Very tasty and portions were very generous. Great for a casual meal. Beer selection lacking, but lots of rum and tequila drinks. Too bad it is so far from Maine.\n",
            "Beeindruckend! I was told in advance to expect good things at Karl's. That began with the smell of the cooking sausages while still in the parking lot. The deli has everything I would want and expect, and the shelves in the middle aisles had all the confections my German co-workers used to bring back when they went home to visit their families. Those strudels in the pastry case looked delicious too, and of course Black Forest Cake!!!  So to go with the wursts we bought, we enhanced the meal with some really good mustard and some sauerkraut (I have no idea how the sodium content compares to US sauerkrauts, but it tasted slightly less salty). The wursts grilled perfectly, what a great meal we had! Next time I hope to sample more in their cafe before making purchases.\n",

            "If you are looking for some Jamaican food, the real deal Jamaican food then put this in your mouth and eat it because it is soooooooo good!\n",
            "I LOVE this place. The food is so good and decently priced. Their new location has so much style now and is now in the more fun section of downtown Sanford. Their fried cheesecake is to DIE for and the service is top notch. Try this place for sure! You will be hooked.\n",
            "Loved the pizza by the slice! So convenient if you just need dinner/lunch for one. Very reasonably priced too!\n",
            "Excellent sushi. Really really fresh fish combined with a super small and cutesy space makes for an excellent experience!\n",
            "Great new spot in Summerport. Excellent selection of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches (they tasted amazing!) and an equally gratifying selection of craft beer on tap. Definitely recommended for anyone in the neighborhood to stop by!\n",
            "First time I ever tried a macaron after hearing they are not that good and this place was good AF. I would definitely recommend anyone to go here and eat them. They are pricey but worth it.\n",

            "\n",
            "The only suggestion I have for the waitstaff/management is possibly giving a recommendation the order in which the chefs intended the things on the dishes to be eaten.  For example, I did not have a clue whether I was supposed to just eat a glob of the aioli foam before/after, or pair it with the (delicious) shrimp head.\n",

            "My husband and I are new to the Atlanta-area, and this was the first restaurant we tried.  We were more than pleased!  It was our anniversary, and they gave us a little card and two complimentary glasses of champagne.\n",
            "\n",
            "They change their entire menu seasonally, but there are special that change weekly.  We ordered the appetizer off the weekly menu.  It was a tuna avocado roll and was completely delish!  We gobbled it right up.\n",
            "\n",
            "My husband had the filet for his main entree, I had the caramelized scallops.  Both were fantastic!\n",

            "Our waiter brought us out every dessert to choose from, and because they are shooters and are only about $2.50 a piece, we grabbed several to share and try. :)\n",

            "We will definitely be making Seasons 52 a regular stop for us! :)\n",
            "Loved the ambiance of the place. Service was above and beyond (we were served by Chloe!) and there was a great wine selection for the parents. Our dessert was spectacular and the stew was hearty and satisfying. Great flavors overall. Definitely coming back to explore the rest of the menu.\n",
            "Okay it is true. This place is a phenomenal restaurant period. Not just great for being in an airport. The food here is so good! I want to keep going back to Atlanta just so I can try more of the menu! The waiter was extremely nice and helpful. I also got a drink that was delicious.\n",
            "I have been a customer of NYPD since first moving to Orlando almost 8 years ago.  Anytime anyone visits from out of town, I take them here and they absolutely love the Pizza (including hardcore New Yorkers).  Paul and his team are excellent and I am now a fan for life.  I highly recommend!\n",
            "REALLY creative and tastes menu. The Stawberry Jalapeño infused margarita I will absolutely be back for. I loved that my Spinach salad came with a doughnut on top. That is how life should be lived.... the garlic doughnut was AWESOME. Cool restaurant too. Great to sit outside and play corn hole with drinks and do the photo booth. I had a great time!\n",
            "Went there tonight with a big group of friends.  The food and service was impeccable! Would highly highly recommend\n",

            "We have eaten here since 1996, and have never been disappointed.  The best dish on the menu is Pescado Veracruzano.  A zesty Veracruz sauce chock full of green chile and capers ladled lovingly over fresh red snapper.  Vera tasty, and vera satisfying.  Yes, I said \"vera\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Standouts are the Fish and Meat Dishes.  Also try the green chile tomatillo salsa.  It is rich and smooth with awesome flavor.\n",

            "\n",
            "Service has always been spotty, but hey, this is Austin.  If you do not like it, tip accordingly.  Every time I have been, the place was packed full, and the waitstaff was really hoofing it, so long waits for unfilled water glasses may occur.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is a go to place for sure. Enjoy!\n",

            "\n",
            "The staff were very friendly. Went on a Sunday evening, kind of between lunch and dinner. Seated right away, the place was about 3/4th full. Lighting is dim, but not too dark or anything negative.\n",
            "\n",
            "Food came quick, which seems contrary to what a number of reviews here have claimed. I also saw lots of people come in after us and get their food while we were eating so I am not sure what to make of the discrepancies. I guess go in with the idea that it is a relaxed pace and you will be plenty happy.\n",
            "\n",
            "We had a slight mishap with the bill at the end (to our favor), where they forgot to add a beer I had to the bill. They noticed as we were leaving and very nicely asked/mentioned it. I told them it would be fine if they re-ran a corrected bill, but when they tried it did not work, so they said it would be free.\n",
            "Fine where the locals eat away from the high priced and hard parking crowded places. Preference offers easy parking and inexpensive wide variety menu. Great fast and cheap lunch specials too includes hot and sour soup. Lots of choices of meat beef, pork, chicken and fish dishes. Only downside is that it is a very small cozy place so sometimes full.\n",
            "I love the transformation of the this place in the last year. I used to go here all the time when it was Arabian Breeze and after they just changed the name over to Nicholas it is become more busy. The menu has changed slightly, but still is great. The sandwich combos are huge, so if you are looking for lighter fare I recommend the ala carte. I made this mistake recently not know how much was in a combo. I always end up taking stuff home. The owner of both Nicolas restaurants can be found here regularly at lunch. He is fun and outgoing! If you can save the room for it order the baklava, but again you can just take it to go!\n",
            "This is not a Pizza place it is soooo much more. Yes, they make great pies, but I come here for the gyros and meat lasagna.  It is has ample room, outdoor seating and a bar drafts on tap.  These guys have nailed it, and with the recent addition of Debbie (formerly of Goldberg's on North Druid Hills) you are sure to enjoy service by a consummate professional and genuine good person.\n",
            "You have heard do not judge a book by its cover and this is a perfect example. It is the most fabulous Italian restaurant in Columbus no doubt in my mind however, it is kind of tucked in this nondescript strip mall near Polaris. Artie and his wife Natasha are gracious hosts who really take time with their customers. It is old school. A beautiful bottle of wine hand picked, a homemade dinner and service beyond what you find unfortunately almost everywhere today. The homemade limoncello is so good that you could skip dessert and just have this aperitif. But my children love the chocolate bomb that Natasha makes. The one side of the restaurant is cozy tables and the newer side is for larger parties. If you have a nice big party of over 20, do not hesitate to call them. Or people in from out of town. It is impressive and they do not disappoint.\n",
            "This place is definitely a hip choice for a casual dinner. But you can always dress it up like a good pair of jeans . I have done girl's nights and quick bites (with the boyfriend)here and it is great for both.  The ambiance is one of the things that strike me the most. Trendy yet comfy.\n",
            "First off, I think Glutenus Minimus is such a great name!  Secondly, they have a retail location now!  I had the pleasure of meeting the owner on Saturday morning.  Their open kitchen is so clean and everything smells SO GOOOOOD!!\n",
            "\n",
            "My sister has Celiac Diease and I decided to try out Glutenus Minimus and get her a treat.  I gave her a GF pumpkin muffin, I wanted the carrot cake, but they did not have it made that time.  I also eyed the chocolate chip cookies and sampled the brioche.\n",
            "\n",
            "The brioche was really good.  I would never have known it was GF.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I gave her the pumpkin muffin and she was so excited because she loves pumpkin but does not love that she can never eat muffins.\n",
            "\n",
            "She gave me a bite, now, the texture was great and the muffin was so fresh as it was made that day.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, it did have a very odd aftertaste and she and I both agreed on that.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would definitely come back to try more delights.  Even if you are not GF, you would probably enjoy something there and I would guess it is much healthier than say, Dunkin' Donuts.\n",
            "Went to lunch here 3-19-2013. We had a friendly greeting from the man behind the counter. We chose a table near the window. We were quickly asked our drink order. My friend asked the waitress a question about the menu and was given a friendly answer and took our order. We did not wait very long and our food arrived. BEST French dip I have ever had. My friend had biscuits and gravy and she really liked it. We paid our check and had a friendly goodbye as we left. We look forward to coming back to try more things on the menu. It seems like a very nice well run place.\n",
            "Five stars for the Stromboli alone! Did not try anything else. My parents brought this to our house for dinner along with 2 pizzas. I did not try the pizza but it looked average (nothing special) but the Stromboli was out of the park! We have lived in Westerville for over a decade and never made it down to this place for whatever reason. This is the go to Stromboli place now. I might try something else but probably will not. Excellent!\n",
            "I usually go here with my brothers on Saturday or Sunday for lunch.\n",
            "The hostess is always so nice, it borders on scary. The last time I came here she group hugged my brothers and I, and told us how nice it was to see us. If she was not so adorable I would probably be mad about her entering my personal space. I would be all \"Oh no you DI-INT\", but she is so sweet, I just hug back.\n",
            "\n",
            "On to the food. Pho Tai! Ooooohhhhh Pho Tai. I dream about you at night. I think about you while I am working, sometimes when I am not. You just may be my soup soul-mate. You are so hearty, beefy, wonderful. You warm me like no other soup can. You also get rid of my hangover, which is always much appreciated. Hoysin? You better stay away from my Pho, I will throw your ass off the table, I am not even joking.  Sambal? Sriracha? You guys better join the party, Pho Tai is not the same when you guys are not here.\n",
            "Visiting Atlanta from New York and wanted to try a place that would be good for date night. We were greater by an amazing nice staff, sat at a beautiful booth table, and had the nicest server. She was sweet and knowledgeable. I am not much of a steak eater however our waitress suggested the special for the week which was an Asian meat paired with BBQ shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes. I decided to get that and my boyfriend got the ribeye. We started off with having the shrimp cocktail and the sesame seared tuna, they both were amazing! Before our food came I had the pino nior red wine which was one of the best wines I have ever had. The food came out and like the rest of our meal was beyond amazing. My boyfriend, who eats steak all the time, said it was the best steak he has ever had in this life. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great steakhouse, friendly staff, and amazing food! Will come back if I am in Atlanta again!\n",
            "Delicious and fresh eggs Benedict and grits!!  Great service and open early on the weekends. Definitely worth a visit.\n",
            "Great family owned and operated place. Not like any of the chain Brazilian restaurants. Wonderful  atmosphere and service and really good food. Came in for a quick business diner and stayed for a couple of hours. Really enjoyed the place. Highly recommended!\n",
            "This food is and was so freaking delicious. I got the traditional Gyro (lamb and beef) with a grilled shrimp on the side. Omg it was so good I called them and told them will always order from this place when I do not want to cook\n",
            "We have eaten here several times, mostly in the late evenings. \n",
            "\n",

            "I have had my fair share of award-winning food, but Uchiko just blew me away and was one of the highlights of my Austin trip.  A group of 4-5 people is the perfect size for everyone to sample a lot of different things.\n",

            "The cherry on top was that our subtotal per person was only $25. $25!!!  Where I live a meal like this would be at least double that price.  Paul, please move out here, there is definitely room for you in San Francisco.\n",
            "I have tried several things from the walrus and it is all very good. Wings, nachos, chili everything has always been good. But what really made me enjoy the walrus is the burgers I have had. I have tried 3 different burgers here and they are all great the main reason being that they cook them the way you ask. So many times I order medium or medium rare when I am out to eat and they all come out over cooked but not at the walrus. Every time I have ordered burgers they have been cooked just the way I ask for them. Looking for a cool spot downtown and a great burger I recommend checking this place out. Great location. Cool staff.\n",
            "Delicious.  I have been here for happy hour on two occasions and need to plan a dinner visit.  The happy hour menu is reasonably priced, has many options, and most importantly is delicious.  I have had the 2 ceviches, burger, grilled pork skewers, and the choripan.  All were very good but my favorites were the pork skewers and the vegetable ceviche.  The design of the restaurant is very nice and the patio seating fills up quickly.\n",
            "Max & Dylan's is one of my go to places. Menu items I recommend: Ahi Tuna salad, Mac & Cheese, Clam Chowder. Sooo good the staff is friendly and the drinks are amazing.\n",
            "This place is sooooo good. Originally we were quoted a wait of 1 hour and 45 minutes for brunch!! FOR BRUNCH! I have never been anywhere with a wait like that. But then there was some counter seating that no one in front of us wanted. The wait ended up only being about 5 minutes. My lucky day. \n",
            "\n",
            "I got the Le Complet which consists of Flatiron Steak, 2 Sunny Eggs, Caramelized Onion & Piquillo Goat Cheese Crostini, Romesco & Seasonal Greens. To be honest, I usually never order anything with steak in it and I only did so because my doctor recently said I am borderline anemic. But I have no regrets. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Every item on this plate was seasoned perfectly. Even the salad was balanced with the sweet and tart. \n",
            "\n",
            "My husband got the Les Boulettes which has 2 Poached Eggs, Spicy Moroccan Lamb Meatballs, Roasted Pepper, Black Olive & Tomato Stew with Raita and Grilled Focaccia. No greens in this dish but still a lot of deliciousness. Whenever you look at a tomato-based stew/sauce, you expect some level of tart and acidity. Not here. Totally perfect and with adequate spice too.  My only wish was a little more bread because the cheese spread was so good and there was so much of it. \n",
            "\n",
            "Despite how cute the waffles look in pictures, they tasted okay. I think it is because they are not made to order (at least I do not think so since I saw a bunch in the glass case). They are missing that fresh-from-the-waffle-maker quality. But the dips are totally worth it. I especially recommend the maple syrup because they get it from a supplier who makes it in small batches. It is way better than the commercial stuff we are used to! It has an earthy aroma and is less sweet too. \n",
            "\n",
            "It is loud in here but I like the upbeat atmosphere and music (they were playing Duran Duran at one point). It is not the most ideal place for young kids though.\n",
            "Freaking loved it. Although, being a New Yorker you will picture the museum to be a lot bigger than it actually is, it was worth the mini tour and small activities. \n",
            "I took a risk knowing I do not like any dark chocolate, pretty much chocolate in general. Only chocolate I am able to eat is white or snickers/peanut chews. The kind of chocolate where I can taste less of the chocolate and more of the peanut & caramel. I did the wine and chocolate tasting and must I say, I am so happy I did! Doing this gave me a different perspective to both wine and chocolate. Now I can feel free to taste chocolate and think maybe it is not that bad after all.\n",

            "Okay first of all I have to admit I am new to Yelp but not to Portland. I was frequenting II Piatto 15 years ago when it opened. It was a tradition for me to go every year on my birthday as well as dinner now and again. I moved away for several years and moved back a few years ago and just sort of kept it in the back of my mind unti I read the weird negative reviews yesterday. It was my birthday and I wanted to return there unsure if the original owners were still there......honestly I almost did not make the reservations due to the negative reviews! I had never experienced anything that the haters were writing about. I HAD TO INVESTIGATE! First of all this is not a place to dine at if you have to catch a movie in an hour. IT IS A QUALITY EXPERIENCE. The owner cooks all of the meals himself with one other chef so expect to wait a little it is worth it. It is a place people go to experience delicious fresh ecclectic creative italian food. I went with 2 others and we had a friendly server who brought our drinks in a timely manner and our beet salads were so delicious and we did not wait very long. I was happy to see that the smokey mushroom crepes were still on the menu:) My mom ordered the ahi tuna with pear sauce and brussel sprouts.She loved it! She has been to Italy a few times and is a bit of a foodie. My friend ordered the portobello linguini and she loved her meal as well. I am confused about the negative reviews. There was even a huge party of about 10 people at a table near us and they were all laughing and eating boisterously! THANK YOU II Piatto for being as GOLDEN as ever and making my birthday perfect:) ALSO BEST CORNMEAL CRUST TIRAMISU EVER! Also cudos to the bartender for making us creative non-alchoholic cocktails(he brought them to us to make sure we like them).\n",

            "Came here before an 8:00 pm performance at the Fox.  We had 5:15 reservations. Due to traffic, (no surprise) called and told them we were running a bit late. No problem, was told our reservation would be held for an additional 15 minutes. Parked in the lot adjacent to the Fox  for $30, and the restaurant was right next door on the corner.  We were seated immediately, all the way in back of the dining room. Very nice ambiance, and cozy. Ordered the Bruschetta appetizer which was wonderful and tasted oh so fresh! My husband ordered the linguini with clams, shrimp and calamari.  I ordered the pappardelle with lamb ragout.  Both were wonderful and portioned perfectly!  Service was nice not rushed, and we had time for dessert and coffee. We were done with our meal around 7:20 pm.  Quick walk down the street to the Fox with time left to get settled.  Also, on a side note, although it has nothing to do with the restaurant, this particular parking lot has a police officer directing cars out after the performances, so we were out of the lot in 5 minutes! Probably why parking here is so $$$, but definitely worth it.  All in all, a wonderful evening!!\n",

            "Bob's Italian Food Store is the best choice for food in Medford. I have been coming here for three years now and have always had exceptional service. If you want top quality italian food then this is the right place to visit. To go subs, trays of eggplant, and fresh imported cold cuts are all offered at this location.\n",

Sit at the counter like we do to meet the staff, and chat them up! You will learn they are an amazing and friendly family that loves crossfit. Well worth the wait in line!\n",
            "If you have not been here, you are missing out! Fantastic HH! Great range of wines; price points are quite reasonable! Lovely and solicitous staff! Quaint atmosphere! My pasta dish was exceptional! We were here on a Wed. It was busy but not crazy! Make it your next choice!\n",
            "There is nothing but 5 stars to give to a place that hosts you so very warmly with delicious food. The dumplings - yum. The soup - yum. The rice - oh my Yum. I cannot imagine what it would be like to live in a city that causes me to enjoy this place on a regular basis. I will be coming back to Vancouver just for the dumplings. Get thy-self over there and order up some great food.\n",
            "I have been here a few times and always order the tonkatsu ramen. It is absolutely delicious, the noodles always taste so fresh and the broth is rich and savory. I could not imagine ordering the richer version! The pork is tender and the egg is always cooked to perfection. Service is decent but I realllly love this ramen. \n",

            "I have been to iPic many times and it is always such a treat.  I always get there at least an hour early to enjoy the bar/waiting area.  I love the pool table and the general ambiance.  There are tons to seating areas in the bar so it is never been a problem to find a place to sit--a major plus for me in the busy city of Austin.  I have personally never had a bad a experience with customer service--all the waiters have been attentive and friendly.  \n",

The seats fully recline--there is a blanket and pillow--the sound is great and I love that the arm rests also serve as a cubby for your personal belongings.  The food choices are interesting and they have a lot of options--including easy bites if you struggle with eating in the dark like I do.  \n",
            "\n",

            "The owners are just about the sincerest shopkeepers one can find in this cute tucked away albeit centrally located shop; making it a great place to share and catch up with an old friend. Listen there tea is great, and that is great if your a big kid and you like those things but I am all about the hot cocoa, let us be honest you know you miss it and they have those big open for-here cups tons of room whip cream. Like a lot.  \n",

            "Let me tell you about the staff: these cats just have a real sublime authentic nature about themselves--from their customer service to really caring about what they serve every time is apparent. Like the home made soups, I recommend the \"soup de jour\" even though they seem to have really hard time with keeping the recipe consistent, (joke)...there rolling soup de jours (\"soup of the day\"...if you follow) are SO good. Please, eat them. They also decorate quite well which is why I am working on inviting myself over for dinner at there home, just because I want to see what it looks like, (I am redecorating, I need ideas). Also, they have a really great signature pad plenty of room to draw funny pictures.\n",

            "The food is incredible!  The sweet & sour and the beef & broccoli were my favorites.  Both with meat substitutes, and both soooo good.  We had 4 people eating and shared for the whole table.  There was not one thing that was not wonderful.  The gentleman who was the only one working the front of the house, was so friendly.  He was on the go, constantly seating, taking orders, cleaning tables, but still had time to be very friendly.  He was there every few minutes to top off our water.  And best of all--it is less than a block from my home!  I see frequent visits in the near future.\n",

            "The Udon here is awesome!! I have been here a couple of times and each of the dishes I have gotten taste really authentic! The atmosphere when you walk in is very calming because the lights are dim and they play soft music which is a plus. The waiters greeted me with a bow (so polite) as soon as I walked in and I was seated immediately. I chose the curry udon with an extra side of rice as well as a green tea. My drink came out within a minute and my food was out in about 10 minutes steaming with deliciousness. The waiter explained why each little side was and explained how to eat the ramen which was really nice of him. The udon was chewy and slippery (which is how I like it) and the curry was delicious! It was not like the typical curry flavor I usually get at Indian/Asian restaurants but it was full of flavor. The portion size is not that big which is why I got an extra side of rice but I finished all of my food. I have heard great things about the cold dipping udon which I would have to try next time. The service was impeccable and overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend!\n",
            "First I must commend the management - we ordered online, and beyond menu failed to deliver our order.  After an hour plus and no food, I called the restaurant.  Once it was clear our order had gotten lost, management made sure 1.  We got food fast - took rover over the phone. 2. Comped the meal. 3. Sent us a gift certificate to make up for our wait.  Amazing.  THEN she called Beyond Menu and I received notification Of the refund to our credit card.  \n",

            "One of our favorite restaurants! The food is always really good, the large and diverse menu caters to our varying tastes, the staff are all very friendly and attentive, the seating and noise levels are comfortable, you can see various sports games on different tvs, yet it is not intrusive. All in all, a great place to eat or relax and watch a game!\n",

            "We would like to acknowledge one of this restaurants staff members he is an acting manager and was working the night shift on this date. Cedric went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service where this restaurant would have lost loyal customer that is a frequent customer that dines at this restaurant,  but because of the diligence and customer care this acting manager shown by going out of his way contacting my husband to find out how his service was and what he could do to make his visit much more enjoyable we truly appreciate it the fact that he looked in to the issue we had and quickly resolve it by reaching out to us and getting our order to us and having our order correct we have never experienced this form and level of customer care and for this very reason we both want to acknowledge the  excellent quality customer provided to us by this acting manager  Cedric. \n",
            "I cannot express how surprised and happy we were when Cedric walked up to us with our order and had our order correct. A situation that would have turned into us being the customer not wanting to go back to the restaurant again because of the poor service we received by the waiter or waitress handling our section and the wait time that we incurred during our visit but because the acting manager took the initiative to go beyond and above to provide us with superb service is why we will continue visiting this restaurant, and has changed our mind completely. \n",
            "We will continue to be your loyal customer, from the Scott family and your loyal customers who currently resides at Highlands @ West Village!!\n",

            "I will not repeat the positive reviews--suffice it to say that this is the place for you if you like seafood, imaginative preparations, and personalized service. But--if management reads this review-I am begging you, please put cushions on the hard wooden chairs. It is a long dinner. Have mercy!\n",
            "Must chime in on this one. Ever since I lived in the Hawthorne neighborhood this place has been a favorite. If you do not think their truffles are the best, you do not like chocolate. There are great, fresh, and local. I declare Ja Civa's A #1!\n",
            "I have never had better, more creative doughnuts in my life. Do not miss the crème brulé, the blueberry bourbon basil, or especially the hard apple cider fritter!\n",
            "There is not much bad you can say when practically everything on the menu was delicious.  Noteworthy items...arros negre, lamb skewer, and papas bravas.  Service was fantastic as well...this is definitely worth a second trip!\n",
            "Really good brunch. My son and I both had the Irish breakfast, and it was delicious. The bangers and the white pudding were especially good.   The Bloody Mary was also very good. Medium was not too spicy. \n",

            "Free burrito or taco or quesadilla for students. Thanks guys for this amazing free food offer.\n",

            "For $6-7 you can get a lunch box to go which includes a stir fry and veggies over rice. Delicious! My favorite is actually the marinated chicken over rice under the BBQ meats section of the menu. Such a good lunch to-go. Compared to the other fast food lunch alternatives - hands down I am taking Ho Ho Chinese food anyday. Call ahead from work then drive over and it is always hot and ready for pick up.\n",

            "If we choose to dine in, recently I have been ordering their wonton soup. A small is $6.25 and you get 12 wontons in a flavorful broth. Some would argue the broth is on the salty side, but I like it. The service is quick and they know you have to get back to work.\n",

            "It was initially a little tricky finding the restaurant if you are coming from the back side of the shopping center. Drive towards the Red Robin sign and you cannot miss Ho Ho. Lots of parking available.\n",
            "I have been coming here for years.  the waffle is the same awesome quality year after year and the owners are just a joy to be with.  They have started baking breads and those are simply irresistible just like their waffles.  do yourself a favor and check this place out no matter where you live!  a must visit when in Stevenson.\n",
            "Love, love, love this place. The staff is friendly, the place is very clean and the food is great. We usually hit this on Sunday morning after church and it is usually not too busy. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.\n",
            "One word...YUM! Fresh and delicious. Small menu so they can concentrate on doing everything well. New menu items...ceviche and spring salad with brussels\n",
            "The wait was only 30 minutes, meanwhile we sat at the bar for drinks.  The wait staff was knowledgeable about the wine selection and ordered Pinot Noir.  Very smooth, fruity.\n",

            "The server, Jackson, was quite friendly and tended to our table with excellent service.  The Smoked Salmon was cooked to perfection!  The Oyster, Lobster, Crab and Shrimp was presented with 6 sauces.  My first time trying Oysters was one I will not forget.  \n",

            "Awesome job Jackson and J Gilberts for a fantastic dining experience.  Highly recommended\n",
            "I am a little afraid that if I give this place too good a review, its quiet, spacious industrial- loft-style space will quickly become overrun with people and I will not be able to get any work done here. But I suppose if no one ever comes here besides me and a few others they will go out of business, so here you go. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Food is reasonably priced and the massive texas toast with banana and peanut butter is basically a three dollar meal. Lots of exotic drink choices to choose from, and they also have dipped ice-cream, a nutella empanada, and delicious-smelling pizza. Board game night once a week. Hipsters will love the mason jar glasses.  \n",

Service is great true Portland service lol killer spiced bloody and the special today oh my.... ham with red eye gravy over grits I almost licked the plate that was so so good thanks for the good food !!!!

You can also get a sample of a wine at your dining table if you are unsure  of choice. The food is fabulous  tasting and  served hot and eye appealing. Would highly recommend  this resteraunt.\n",
            "I had my husband's surprise birthday at senor patron yesterday. The service was EXCELLENT!! The staff was very friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond to provide an excellent service. This place is best to host large parties. I had invited 20 plus guests and nobody complained. The food came out quickly and there was no confusion about split bills. I came to know about this place because I am a part of an organization Netip that frequently host events at this location. I am so glad that i hosted my event here. I will definitely come here again. I am very thankful to the staff and management at senor patron.\n",

My wife ordered the Chicken Arrabbiata and I had the Chicken Saltinbocca.  Both were delicious...but we highly recommend the Arrabbiata.  The waitstaff was wonderful-at the end of the meal, they informed us that the glass of wine each that we had ordered was on the house (they did not know we were celebrating our anniversary).  A pleasant experience and delicious food!\n",

            "\n",

            "Finally, a reasonably priced delicious restaurant in my hood! I have eaten here twice and both times were excellent. The serve huge portions of high quality meats & fish. My fav is the gyro plate with salmon. It was at least a half pound of salmon with hummus, rice, and bread. The salmon was cooked to perfection and topped with pesto. Hummus is homemade. My wife loved the salad plate chef special which came with salmon, ahi, octopus and bread. Fish was light and had so much flavor. Looking forward to trying all the daily chef specials. The young woman who takes the orders is super sweet and friendly. The owner is also really nice and welcoming. \n",
            "If you like Mediterranean flavors, you have to give this place a try.\n",
            "Fresh. Everything is fresh. Got the burrata as a starter and LOVED the flavor pairings; it was served with prosciutto, wood fired peaches (less sweet with an amazing charred flavor), and rosemary honey. While everything on the menu looks awesome, I definitely recommend trying the wood fired pizza. It is really hard to find that style of pizza in the northeast, and it is actually a really authentic Italian way of making pizza. To top it all off, our service was excellent! Our waitress was very personable and sincere, and she offered great recommendations.\n",

            "I have eaten at olive gardens all over the USA.  Never have I ever had chicken so tender, bread not hard, flat bread not burned and service so perfect.   The chicken scampi was the best I Have ever had.  I had the potato soup which was a first for me and was also very good.  The chicken flat bread was just as amazing not to mention one of the greatest waitresses I have had in a very long time.  Cudos to the chef and the management.\n",
            "I have never given a five star before.  This place earned it.\n",
            "These bad boys are popping up everywhere in Orlando, and I could not be happier about it. Like the other stations for the chain, this one has plenty of pumps, which means you never have to wait. If you are like me, anything that saves time is a win. \n",
            "\n",
            "As I have said in other reviews for this chain, who would have thought that gas station food could be tasty??? Wawa proves that gas station food does not have to equal disappointment and food poisoning. Instead, they offer up fresh subs, tasty mac and cheese and even shakes! Of course if you just want some classic coke and a bag of doritos, you will find that here too. \n",

            "This place is clearly more popular than it is neighbors in this office bldg/mall setting. There was a long line both times I went. A server comes out and takes your order while you wait so that your food comes quickly after being seated. I found this to be a great idea, for customers as well as the restaurant. The ramen was fantastic! I cannot wait to go back.\n",
            "5 Stars for Best Pancakes in Portland! We have eaten a lot of breakfasts in Portland, at a lot of nice & popular places. But we are rarely impressed by anyone's pancakes. Either they are clearly from a box (and we have spied Krusteaz in the open kitchens of many favored breakfast spots), overly dense, or overly huge. The sourdough pancakes at Sanborn's are A-mazing. Unique tangy flavor, perfect size, springy texture, perfectly cooked. A half size was 3 decent sized cakes. Our other entree was the Smoked Apple German Pancake, with smoked gouda, smoked almonds and some kind of delicious caramelized brown sugar glaze. I had the option of subbing in double-cream smoked white cheddar, which I am sure would also be great. I was skeptical at the $10+ price tag for this special, but it was worth far more than that. Quality ingredients, expert preparation, interesting combination = extremely satisfying meal. And extremely filling, which is not always the case for me. Other items were poached eggs (great) and biscuits that our 3 year old loved (good, but of the cake-y variety, we prefer flaky). Speaking of the 3 year old, the staff was welcoming and friendly to our infant & preschooler, and immediately provided a cool take-home toy for her to play with. They were friendly to all of us, prompt and responsive, and knew many of the regulars there by name. I liked that the regulars ranged from young neighborhood families to older couples. Sometimes I feel like my breakfast server has just gotten home from the bar and is resentful of working the morning shift; understandable, but not the most positive vibe to start the day with. Not at all like that at Sanborn's, even though from the conversation I came to know that some servers have serious music careers as well. They seemed genuinely enthusiastic about making it a good experience for diners, even at 8am. We will be back to try the egg dishes!\n",

            "I remember the first time I went here and a member of our party was upset about a vein of fat in the prime rib. I did not even notice( and loving fat, did not care) and the waiter was brilliant. Maybe it loses a half a star for that. Everytime I have been since it is been such a pleasure here. You cannot really miss anywhere in the North End. Adam Smith's Law of Competition weeds out the mediocre actors in the North End. Prezza is definitely the Porcshe of North End dining\n",

            "Had the chicken fingers with Mac, fries, and dirty rice. The fingers were very large, the sides were divine. The fries are curly like the name. Dirty Rice was made from scratch and also great. There is a wait, but its worth it.\n",

Well, considering myself such a connoisseur of French Fries, I knew I had to try these on my next trip to Austin....which I did.  All I can say is they were absolutely CORRECT!!!  The crunchiness was perfect.  The batter that they are fried in is very tasty.  The aioli sauce for the fries make it even better.  Now, with my fries I had a hamburger.  It was cooked to perfection.  Other people in my party had the fish & chips, chicken guacamole BLT sandwich, and the chicken salad sandwich.  Everybody raved about their meal.  Needless to say the food was very good.  The service was excellent.  I will make sure that next time I am in Austin, I will pay them a visit.\n",

            "I went here years ago when my family was at Disney. The food here was so good that I still remember it today. Simply put..this place was amazing. I had the lamb shank and it is still one of the best things I ever ate. \n",

The Jerk chicken was amazing, the curry chicken, plantains, cabbage, peas and rice, and the oxtail dinner all cooked to perfection. Wow! If you Want a burst of great Flavor and fulfilling food. Try this place. Best Jamaican I have had in a long time! I give it more than 5 stars! 10 stars.\n",

            "I came here while visiting Vancouver from Washington and I am gutted we do not have a Catch 122 in Seattle! I have never had such amazing food. The duck poutine was delightful, all of the breakfast we had their was amazing. Their food is all I can think about... lol. But really I highly recommend if you want some DELICIOUS food!!!\n",

Cody is fantastic behind the bar and makes great fresh cocktails and suggestions. Lots of beer choices and happy hour deals for food and drinks too. Go now,  you will not be disappointed.\n",
            "My Mixed Plate is so tasty! My husband liked the taste very much. It is kind of oily but it taste good so I do not care about the oil anymore. The plate comes with rice so the Asian in me got so happy about it. The desert is different but it is good too - like a flan but made in different way. The SERVER is wonderful and awesome! It is a little slow because he is the only server this day and time BUT because he is wonderful - 5 Stars for you all!\n",

            "I never had good Indian food in Boston/Cambridge area, I am very picky when it comes to Indian food. I not only dislike, but hate the dish that most Indian restaurants call \"Biryani\", its not even close to biryani. \n",
            "\n",
            "But Punjabi Grill, has THE AUTHENTIC Biryani as I have had it in different parts of India. It has the right spices, the right aroma and the meat (goat) is not hard to chew . I ordered from here reading a recommendation from one of my friends and boy he was right. I used Door Dash for delivery and I would be glad to pay $6 for delivery again for that quality of food. \n",

            "At this point, there is no other restaurant that comes to mind when I have that \"I need comfort food\" feeling sending growls from my stomach. Sure I can drop a pretty penny and get some croutons dropped into my breadbowl soup with a side of bread at Panera, along with a side Salad served with a couple bricks of baguette tossed at me in at attempt to cause an amnesiatic accident. But I could never forget Crispers.\n",
            "\n",
            "A friendly staff, quiet music, comfortable seating, and central location, are just the perks to eating there. Perfectly balanced salads, warm sandwiches, hearty soups, and crispy Flatbread are easily picked and split off the menu with their Half & Half deal, and it is rare to be able to finish both plates of food. The dessert counter serves up tasty frozen coffee, and small bags of artisan cookies that are perfect for finding a seat and spending an afternoon reading or studying. The Biscotti Gelato is simply amazing! \n",

I was there celebrating my 31st birthday and Alice, the front desk employee, noticed and wished me a happy Birthday which was sweet. I forgot my toothbrush and she sent a little toothbrush/toothpaste kit up to the room a few minutes after we got to the room which was a big help. I was even more surprised when 15 minutes later there was another knock on the door. It was balloons, a card, chocolates, and a Disney Birthday button with my name on it! What a nice surprise! Thank you Alice! \n",

Make it there before 1 on the weekends or they will sell out! And when they sell out they close up shop! So if your heart is set on a hot and fresh donut, get there early! There is is street meter parking sometimes it is hard to get a spot. Also seating inside is limited, but there is a lot of nice places to take a seat outside and people watch. All in all a must try and after you try you will be hooked! :)\n",

I checked in for a conference on reservations that someone else made me, and low and behold to my surprise my name was not there, and the hotel was 100% booked! Debra went above and beyond looking for my name in the data base as well as surrounding hotels to see if my name was elsewhere. In addition, the next day she passed me in the hall and remembered who I was and stopped me asking me if all was okay and if there was anything else she could do. I am very impressed with Debra and the hotel management needs to be aware of what an awesome employee they have on their team!\n",
            "Deliciously amazing. Service was friendly, prompt and we never ran out of water.\n",
            "Delicious goat coconut. Perfectly spiced. The saag paneer was to die for. Not the mushy goupy saag, but a good balance of smooth & creamy and still the flavor and integrity of the spinach intact. The bread basket was HUGE. Portions were more than generous. Their lunch prices are SO low, lower than I am used to for Indian food. Their chutneys/sauces served alongside the meal are ALL delicious. My favorite is the green-yogurt based one, and the other that is spicy with I think sliced onions in it. We were fighting over it, we actually ate ALL the sauces and were a little embarrassed because we wanted more.\n",

I made all kinds mistake such as not knowing any word on the menu. I did not know the table manners. I still do not know much now though. The waitress was very kind, help me to order and telling me the utensils. The food was great, contrary to some over-seasoned food I had had. I love to have dinner over there.\n",
            "I am pretty sure their pineapple upside-down pancake is the best pancake I have ever eaten! That combined with their delicious hash browns, gourmet local coffee and inviting dining area make this an awesome place to stop for breakfast!\n",

            "Hopdoddy, I am not totally sold on the name, but they are not kidding around with their burgers and they fit in beautifully with the S. Congress scene. I appreciate anywhere that makes their own bread, cuts their own fries, grounds their own meat, churns their own ice cream, recycles plastic, glass, paper and composts food just because of the effort that it takes to do all that; but I love a place that does all that and is really good at it, like Hopdoddy. I think I will lovingly call it HD. \n",
            "\n",
            "I went with a friend who had also never been before. I was a little confused at where to go when I first walked in because you order by the kitchen and it is in the back. I think it works great, it is just not apparent right off the bat that you order at the counter and seat yourself. \n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, we went half-seys on the Llano Poblano and the Magic Shroom burger and got an order of fries. Food came out promptly, hot and fresh. They have a nice selection of sodas on tap and an awesome array of sauces with little twists on the classics. The horseradish honey mustard sauce was our favorite and was so yummy to dip fries in. I love the no nonsense way they serve their food; on a mini cookie sheet with a paper liner on it. Paper towels conveniently located right on the table. Just the perfect set up to be all about the food, and this place totally is. \n",
            "\n",
            "Both burgers were delicious and awesome. Full of flavor with really nice touches, like on the shroom burger the goat cheese was rich and creamy and you just wanted to keep eating it forever. On the poblano burger the bacon along with the roasted peppers was such a nice combo in your mouth. I think at a normal burger place we would have given up without finishing all of our food but not only did we eat both burgers but also every last crumb of fry. YUM! \n",
            "\n",
            "We also both commented on how we could not wait to try some of the less traditional burger options next time we came like the ahi tuna burger or a salad. We will also save room next time for one of the delicious sounding shakes they offer but alas, we were too stuffed and happy to not fully enjoy another option. Great food, great service, great atmosphere, great location, earth friendly...I am definitely a fan for life and definitely going back and taking my friends.\n",
            "I ate here TWICE for brunch during my five day trip to Vancouver. Their eggs Benedict with white cheddar cheese is a must order along with their hash. We also ordered their freshly squeezed apple juice. Everything tastes great along with their service. Wish I can revisit Canada just to eat this again!\n",
            "YUM! I love going to nearly extinct chains. I believe this is the last Sizzler on the east coast. They do not have much of a buffet. Interesting tidbit: the \"Salad Bar\" is the buffet, so for $5.99 you get salad plus whatever is out there. They had a small buffet of hot foods and you can probably have a meal off it. I opted for a steak + the \"salad bar\". Service was fantastic! My waitress reminded me of a woman I worked with at a restaurant. Food was all very good. No whipped topping for the jello though. Prices are a tad high for some items, but you are across from Disney. I also got a come back voucher for 15% off. I would love to visit again.\n",
            "I came here the other night for a date with my husband because we wanted to try the new menu.  The food was still delicious as ever and the service was still top notch.  I am looking forward to being able to enjoy the new cocktail menu once Baby #2 gets here and I am no longer the DD!\n",
            "Great food and good experience. Worthy of trying more times and first time for everyone! Beautiful plated flood and tasted great!\n",

            "I have been to Uchiko three or four times now and each time has been an amazing experience. I think each visit trumps the last, probably because I get a little more comfortable and adventurous with what we order. :) \n",

            "\n",
            "The maguro sashimi and goat cheese is a must-order. It is the best thing I have ever tasted. The Shag Roll is another delicious item that we cannot skip. \n",

            "The Bacon Tataki is absolutely delicious and actually pretty filling as far as a tasting plate goes. Very delicious pork belly dish! \n",

            "The sweet corn sorbet desert is a perfect finish to the dinner. I am still thinking about it from last night. :)\n",
            "Always warm and pure yum. You can tell they love food and really giving you a full plate. My fav: meatloaf and green beans (and cherry cobbler). But honestly, they have so much more - and it is all so very good.\n",
            "The Vegan Baja Taco was amazing! The best vegan taco ever! The chipotle cream sauce was delicious, the avocado was fresh and the vegan protein was fried to protection with the cabbage giving the taco the right color and tasty crunch! Made with absolute vegan love by Hector! Yum!\n",
            "My husband and I love 34th Street Cafe as one of our regular \"go to\" places for dinner.  The food is always good, the service great, and the price is reasonable.  My favorites on the menu are the zucchini cake appetizer and the chicken piccata is fantastic.  34th Street is also one of the very best caterers in town. They catered the dinner after my son's wedding in May and the food was fantastic but the planning and service they provided was impeccable.  We had a downpour of rain that day which made staging from the detached garage impossible.  Eddie and his staff were calm and flexible and moved things to the main house with little fuss.  They were truly pros at handling the disruption to our careful planning and we had the most magical evening ever.  I will never think twice about what caterer to hire in Austin.  34th Street is the best!\n",

            "\n",
            "I had the She-Ra Sandwich...and yup, what could be better for a name!?  Turkey, Avocado, Marinated onions, gluten free bread...allllllll good!  There were 3 mini sandwiches (which I really appreciate as gluten free bread tends to be smaller, so I did not feel cheated on the price/size), came with a tasty mixed green side salad.  The bread was fantastic, tasted similar to sourdough sliced bread...nice crisp crust.  \n",

            "Amazing first experience! Regarding other reviews, I did not have to wait for forever to sit or for my food. I went around a normal dinner time 7ish and I got seated immediately. Food took about 15 minutes to come out but I did not even notice since I got sides that came out in about 5-10 minutes. Be mindful that space is a bit tight. The place as a whole is huge but the tables are so close together, mine was booty'd a couple times. Also, it is a really loud environment so be prepared to hear everyone is conversation since we are all are practically screaming at each other. The food is made to be like \"plates meaning they are small in portion and \"family style\" so they are advised to be shared (although you will just end up ordering more like I did). I recommend the duck tacos and the churros with their chocolate rum sauce.. Out of this world!\n",
            "You cannot go wrong at Union Square Donuts: the coffee is great, the tea is great, and the donuts are spectacular, the best I have ever had hands down.\n",
            "I went here a few weeks ago for a work dinner. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was! One of my coworkers found it, and suggested we go. Aside from annoying parking (which is typical in Boston) there was also no valet. \n",
            "\n",
            "I thought the food was really solid and the service was amazing. The wine choices were some of the best I have seen. I actually commented to the waitress about that, and she said the chef is really into wine, so that was the reason why. The cheese and charcuterie cart that came around was awesome. The buratta, proscuitto and olives were amazing! \n",
            "\n",
            "For dinner 2 of us got swordfish and another got the roasted chicken. We were all raving about our meals!  (The three of us are always trying out new restaurants, so we are pretty hard to impress). \n",

            "Lobster rolls were good, but the real winner was the short ribs. Lobster mac and cheese major yumm. Our server was hilarious and had a very foul mouth, but that just added to the fun. Big round booth nice for our group. This place is loud. Be prepared for that if a band is playing.\n",
            "As good as any pizza I have had in the Portland area, up there with Ken's, Apizza Scholls, and Life of Pie.\n",
            "Always a great spot to meet and have a delish lunch. Lots of locals and people after long bike rides hanging out. Wood fired pizzas are incredible. Also the fruit iced teas really good. Quaint space and friendly staff . Deserts are also super yummy!\n",
            "A beautiful date night! The atmosphere was very romantic dim lighting with candles everywhere. The stone crab appetizer was perfection. I had the Langostinos entrée (prawns with creamed grits) and he had the center cut filet with bacon blue addiction. Superb service by our waiter and the manager checked in twice as well. I cannot wait to return, I want to try everything on the menu :)\n",
            "The best place for Biryani in Portland. We had Veg dum biryani, it tasted heavenly. Everything was so appropriate, the taste , the spice levels , the raita. We came all the way from Eugene to Portland for this biryani. I would recommend this place and I would come back here more often. Every penny was worth it. The sides given with this were mirchi ka salan and raita. The taste of these two were very rich. I have never  eaten such tasty mirchi ka salan and raita anywhere in this country so far. \n",

            "The most delicious South Indian food to serve as a great pick me up on a cold, rainy day. Started with perfectly made fresh masala chai and madras coffee. The eggplant was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted at an Indian restaurant! If you are here, try the rava onion masala dosa - absolutely delicious!\n",
            "If you want a great, inexpensive place to dine this is it! 2 people can dine for under $12.00 and walk out full.  The food itself is good not great but the salsa bar offers much more than your basic Willies or Moes. I wish they had discriptions of them.  Overall the tacos are great and their rice is the best I have ever had!!!\n",
            "Great service and fun! The opening acts and emcee were great as well - sometimes better than the main show!\n",

            "Glad the place we tried to eat was too busy so ended up here. Food was excellent and very fresh. Best lox I have had in years. Bagel was fresh and the French Toast was awesome. Staff was friendly and the manager was very attentive (maybe he was the owner). You are could tell he was into running he place.\n",
            "The ladies of Taste of Ethiopia are delightful and the food is delicious. My first taste of Ethiopian food was on a recent trip in Kenya....a close neighbor to Ethiopia. We met friends who are vegan for dinner. The staff took great care in keep our food with meat separate from the delicious vegan/vegetarian options. They have reasonably priced glasses of wine and the food was filling and plentiful. Will definitely be back.\n",
            "Similar to chipotle but much better food and customer service. Xavier took care of us and he and the staff were extremely funny and friendly!\n",
            "Throw on your dancing shoes!!!. This restaurant/ lounge is absolutely wonderful. Great food, customer service and energy. This is a great place to go with a group of friends.\n",
            "So happy we wandered in here! They have a great beer selection and the salsa they started us off with was smokey, spicy, and delish!\n",
            "\n",
            "We ordered a bunch of tacos; all were good but what stood out was the flavorful steak taco - The shrimp was probably my secon favorite. I definitely recommend!\n",
            "Shrimp toast (I have seen it mentioned in every other review as well), fantastic cocktails, and great dark ambience. The food was amazing, and fairly priced.\n",
            "\n",
            "Better than any cocktail venue I have been to in my hometown of Minneapolis. I may just have to go back for seconds before returning home...\n",
            "I am a foodie and this place really exceeded all my expectations!  House made sausage was delicious.  Food was as good as any top restaurant in New York. Wine list was reasonable with many gems from small vineyards.  I wish I could go again tomorrow!\n",
            "The suan la chow show is amazing.  It is one of those dishes that does not seem that spicy on the first couple of bites, but as you eat it, it just keeps getting hotter.  Absolutely delicious.\n",
            "Love the service every time my boyfriend and I come here! A very sweet girl named Jadalyn, I believe, wanted to make sure my boyfriend enjoyed his iced coffee, incase she thought she made it wrong. Very polite and sweet along with the rest of her co-workers!\n",
            "Delicious! I ordered the roast pork with beans and rice. The pork was perfect just like the way my mom makes it. The red beans very flavorful and seem like they have been cooking for hours. \n",
            "I found out this restaurant is about a year and a half old and it is incredibly spotless! There are some high end restaurants in Orlando that are not this clean. \n",
            "I will definitely be back. Great price for the value.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I went here for the first time tonight- even though we live right down the road. It was awesome! Our servier was very friendly and the food came out quickly and the portions were HUGE, especially considering prices are lower than the usual North End restaurants. A woman (i am assuming the owner) asked us how everything was when we got the check, and asked if we had a chance to try the tiramisu. We said we wanted to, but we are just too full. \n",
            "\n",
            "Being super overly hospitable, she said we had to try the tiramisu before we left, especially since it was out first time. She then said to our waiter \"get this nice young couple a tiramisu\", our waiter brought us a tiramisu on the house- and it was amazing! The woman was super nice, saying she hoped to see us again. They definitelty will!\n",
            "Pride's Piccola is the real deal (not that I have ever been to Italy). It is the best pizza I have had in Beverly by far...and they deliver! The ingredients they use make their food taste fresh, healthful (even though its pizza), and delicious.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are weekly delivery clients and order the Margarita Pizza and either the Misticanza Salad, Caprese Salad, or the Proscuitto and Mozzerella appetizer. Each is packed with fresh flavor and feels like a homemade dish. If I could purchase their pizza sauce, I would by the gallons.\n",
            "\n",
            "They did recently add a $5 delivery charge, which was a bummer, but it is that good that we will continue to order on a weekly basis. If you do get delivery, warming the pizza in a low heat oven may be necessary, but totally worth it.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot say enough good things. Just try it. You will thank me. (and them!)\n",
            "Awesome food. Friendly service. Always easy and convenient. Kind of tucked away in the corner of a complex in Tualatin, but totally worth finding it.\n",
            "Every once in a while you come across that one special place.  Tucked deep within a strip center off the side of the road unbeknownst to the hundreds of cars that pass it each day.  For those who are unaware of such diamonds in the rough let me present to you, Andiamo Ristorante.  Upon entering the restaurant I was amazed to find a quaintly intimate dinning area that could have been taken straight from a movie scene. This Italian restaurant has a very classic appeal set to a mandolin based soundtrack.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have to admit it was somewhat difficult to make a decision on what to order because everything on the menu sounded wonderful.  As to not appear as indecisive as I was already feeling I ordered the Linguine Lucy Johnson. (Diced shrimp with cherry tomatoes, portobello mushrooms)  I am not sure who this Lucy Johnson is exactly, but she must be a saint to have such a dish named after her because this dish was heavenly. Just like Andiamo's surroundings the food was absolutely delightful.\n",
            "\n",
            "The over all experience was hands down 5 stars.  I would have loved to have stayed longer drinking more wine, but I knew it was time to gracefully make my exit when the mandolinist played the theme from the Godfather. Like I mentioned before, Andiamo Ristorante's atmosphere was straight out of a movie scene and I know what is about to go down when that song is played. ;)\n",
            "I am a meat eater- think paleo, and I think this place is great! What meat eaters do not seem to get is we can eat vegan/vegetarian food! And when it is good, it is very good! \n",
            "\n",
            "I first tried NF in a yurt in CA; I loved it then & I love it now. I avoid highly processed foods now, and my favorites there tend to be the fake meat items (highly processed) and the cupcakes (so good- but the frosting is highly processed) but I still like eating here every so often. They really do vegan right. It is really all about the sauces & seasonings. I am ok in the kitchen, but I would love to be able to make flavors like they do. I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, \"I coulda made that better at home.\" But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do! Kudos Native Foods for being dedicated to your because AND truly delicious... Not just for vegans!\n",
            "Yum Yum guys.....you are the best! Keep making those awesome cupcakes and see you at the next food truck event! You have to try these......\n",
            "I love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious! I have not yet done the hibachi but they have really great sushi.\n",
            "It is so good that the only negative thing about it is that you wish the burger was bigger. Definitely worth it and they are quite reasonable\n",
            "You absolutely can not go wrong with this place. It is some of the best Thai food in Austin. I usually get the pad-thai or the musmun curry. Both dishes are spectacular. I am a vegetarian, so I always get them with tofu. I love the way they cook and prepare their tofu. It is so delicious! Their crispy vegetable rolls are pretty great too and you cannot go wrong with a Thai iced tea! Definitely one of my favorites. The staff is incredibly friendly and we have never had even close to a bad waiter or waitress. But, there has been more times than one that the wait was so long that we had to go somewhere else. Other than that, it is perfect.\n",
            "Since there are so many restaurants in this area, I am so glad this was our choice. The big meatloaf stack and rotisserie chicken were simply amazing. The service was impeccable. They were so attentive ensuring or drinks were always full. While being attentive, they were not overbearing or annoying. They also gave detailed descriptions on the various menu options to help us make our selections. The food came out surprisingly fast which is not the norm for a restaurant as busy as they are. I will definitely go back the next time I am up in Orlando.\n",
            "Food was amazing and for my day off as a bartender myself Sarah the bartender was nothing but perfect! She handled that full bar like a boss! She was so engaging and was so much fun, definitely coming back just to see Sarah!\n",
            "Definitely, the best north indian cuisine in Austin.\n",
            "Their weekend lunch buffet is a treat - lots of indian delicacies.\n",
            "I usually visit during weekdays - and order off the menu. This place is ridonculous busy on weekends...get there early if you do decide to go on a weekend.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week! The staff is friendly, and the portions are huge! You definitely get a value for your money. If you go on weekends, or Fridays, expect a little bit of a wait time, but trust me when I say the wait is worth it!\n",
            "this is an awesome venue to see music in! I just saw Santigold play there last night and it was amazing!\n",
            "Love the hand pulled noodle love the lamb on a stick love the tea egg. Hope they can serve Xi an style salad like Dongbei Da ban cai or Xin Jiang da ban cai.\n",
            "Heirloom offers the best food on OSU's campus and truly is a best kept secret in Columbus as a whole. I have had nearly everything on the menu, and it is all delicious. The vegan eye-opener burrito, egg sandwich, toasted munster sandwich, quinoa salad, and carrot cake are my personal favorites. Coffee is Crimson Cup (so nothing special), but they have a bottomless mug option for dining in. They get BUSY between 11am and 1pm, so plan accordingly. \n",
            "\n",
            "There are signs asking non-dining patrons not to linger, which is kind of funny and kind of off-putting. The owners and very visible and hardworking. \n",
            "\n",
            "All of that being said, I do think prices could stand to be 15%-20% less due to the not-so-Midwestern portion sizes.\n",
            "Oh how I love cheese steaks!! I love this place when I am in Portland I actually am from Philly and I look forward to going to Portland more than I anticipate going home for a steak..  The environment of the food trucks and the open air vibe adds to the experience..\n",
            "Antica is my favorite pizzeria in the orlando area! This place is so low key that we would not have found it if we were not  avid \"hot and new\" pizza stalkers on yelp. This place is authentic, non gimmicky and so damn delicious.  The restaurant is super cozy and service is always great, but sadly it is usually pretty dead when we go. If you like Neapolitan-style pizza definitely check it out!\n",
            "Probably one of the best Denny's I have been to and I go to a lot of them on my travels. Servers, cook, managers - everyone checked on me to make sure everything was good. Food was better than expected (had the sirloin dinner) and server was very friendly. Would definitely go to again if I ever come to his area again.\n",
            "This place is perfect for anyone who is looking for a cafe to study in with relaxing background music. People who come here are not that loud and you can easily get work done. Also, you can easily find outlets (though they can be a bit hidden). I would completely recommend the muffins and lattes!\n",
            "Great pastry shop! This place is as good as the North End shops, is busy but not mobbed (letting the staff take time to address your requests), and accepts credit cards. The apple turnover I had was fantastic--I did not make it out of the parking lot before I finished it completely. I also left with a nice package of cookies wrapped in string for friends back home. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They helped me in picking out some great pastries and giving me some advice about the area.\n",
            "I am very happy to have found this place.\n",
            "\n",
            "I like beer. a lot. But I like good beer, not cheap beer, and like to try new things.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first thing I found out about this place, and what keeps me coming back, is their selection of Dogfish Head. now I know, you might be wondering \" Well i can get that anywhere, and why would you go somewhere for one beer brand?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But they carry a bigger selection of the DFH Occasional Rarities than anywhere else I have found (these are the special brews DFH makes, once a year or so, big 750 ml win sized bottles, higher alcohol content, etc). So finding a few to choose from is nice.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, they seem to over order (or maybe it is just that people in Brighton do not like DFH??)\n",
            "But this worked out well, as they had DFH Punkin Ale well into December, which was lucky for those who enjoy it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first time we went, was shortly after they opened. i was able to have an intelligent conversation about beer with the clerk working, which was nice, and he told us about tastings they were having to try new things.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was also introduced to 21st amendment beer. It is a craft brewer from the midwest, but in cans vs. glass bottles. I can honestly say I would not have tried it if not recommend, but the 'Hell or high watermelon' is a great summer beer!\n",
            "This is my New Favorite Restaurant. I like to dress up, and so do my family and friends. This is the only place of which I know, in the Lynn area (where I reside) where I do not feel out of place in a $400 outfit. They are also Toddler Friendly, with high chairs, and Priority to The Kid's Meal, which comes even before the adults get the apps!! KUDOS, it buys the entire party TIME, before Melt Down. The Adult Food is par to any I have had in Boston or Cambridge or La Campania, in Waltham. Go there, and tip your Servers well for their Fine Attention.\n",
            "Great diverse selection of bagels, new location is very nice. Bagel sandwiches are fantastic.\n",
            "I always have such good food here and bring anyone I can to try this place.  Tonight we had the duck wings, sea beans, gaucho bread, empanadas, mussels, forest mushrooms, and the branzini.  Sooo good.\n",
            "The best place for coffee and organic pastries. Small batch high quality. Great staff.\n",
            "A casual place to have some good Texas barbecue. Go early if you do not want to wait in a long line.\n",
            "The food is always amazing and service is always great. Be prepared to wait to get a seat because of its popularity. Their curry dishes are delicious! Favorite eats in town!\n",
            "This place is phenomenal!!! The food is absolutely delicious and the prices are very reasonable. We ordered the Papa Rellena & Mini Tequeños as appetizers. Both delicious! We both had the Churrasco which was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing! The sweet plantains were excellent, the yucca was great too!  The food was so good we had breakfast from there this morning. LOL.\n",
            "Came here for hundreds of times during the past two years. Just cannot resist the yummy spicy hot pot here. They just make me feel like going back home, and is sometimes even more tasty! I would order 6 vegetables and 3 small meat for the hot pot with a friend, and in fact I would feel extremely full all the time but cannot help eating up all of them. Sometimes would also try the dishes and the barbecue here, like the spicy eggplant etc. the background music is very \"Chinese pop music style\", and has no difference from a restaurant in China.\n",
            "Yes!  Yes!  Yes!!\n",
            "\n",
            "I miss this place.  I used to order delivery (YES, DELIVERY) from this resto once every other week.  The fish is fresh and I love their riceless rolls!  The osumashi soup is great comfort food when you are feeling sick and it hurts to swallow...but I would order it with every meal because it is so darn tasty!\n",
            "\n",
            "The happy hour has some good deals, and they have wifi!  So if you are able to work from different locations, maybe take off a little early and hit up their HH for the last hour of your day!  ;-)\n",
            "\n",
            "The service and owners are great.  If Jessica is at the bar, she is libel to buy you (or at least coerce you) to get a sake bomb!  She is a lot of fun and the other waiters/waitresses are friendly.  They have a good selection of sake if you are interested in trying some.  I would recommend either the sparkling sake or the pearl.  \n",
            "\n",

            "I have been wanting to try this place for years. I finally went today and I have to admit the food was great. Compared to some of the local places near me. I would go again.\n",

            "What a great yelp find. This place was two blocks from our hotel and it was perfect for a quick, inexpensive breakfast. \n",
            "\n",
            "The breakfast tacos were bomb. I think we all agreed that \"the works\" was the best one. We each got two tacos.. but you could get away with just one and be pretty full.\n",
            "\n",
            "And their espresso was on point. I had a vanilla americano with almond milk and it was probably one of the best ones I have had!\n",

            "Cream - best I have had.\n",
            "If you want real authentic Dumplings, you have to try this place. I have tried every kind of dumpling they offer. I cannot pick a favorite because they are all so good. The goji berry chicken soup is the owners mom's recipe. It was delicious and made me think of my mom's homemade chicken soup. My favorite item on the menu has to be the Pork Belly Buns. The pork was so tender and juicy and the sauce was fingerlicking good.  I never had Pork Belly Buns as good as these anywhere else. Also, I can never come here with out grabbing a bubble Tea to go. I get the Black Sesame Bubble Tea with boba with extra ice. Being a college student this place made me feel at home when ever I came here. The food is home-made with secret family recipes. The staff is very happy to serve you. The dinning room is so artsy and homely. They even have beautiful pillows that make you feel comfortable while you eat, but yet give off the homely feeling. The staff is very friendly, and is quick to answer any questions about the menu, If you are indecisive like myself, they will help you make a final selection. \n",
            "Since I love this place so much, I bought one of their super soft t-shirts made from organic cotton. I love wearing this t-shirt and when they ask me about Dumpling Daughter, I always brag about how good the home-made food is. There is no other place like this. All the other places are just imitations.  This is the REAL DEAL!!! Cannot wait for my next Dumpling Daughter day!!!\n",
            "This place looks awful from the outside. I honestly thought it was out of business for the first 6 mos or so that I have lived here (a block away). The inside, however, looks great.\n",

            "My boyfriend, a die-hard Eagles fan that recently re-located to MA, found it by accident as he wandered the Allston streets looking for a bar that would show the Eagles game (the Patriots were playing at the same time, and every other bar laughed in his face).  The Avenue welcomed him right in - there was even another Eagles fan.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food is really good, especially for the (dirt-cheap) price. Great selection of beer. The bartender was really fun - social, not obnoxious, and treated us really well.  We have since been back several times and had the same great experience.\n",

            "I love this restaurant! Their strawberry margaritas are to die for! I always get the fajitas and they are delicious every time. The restaurant has a cool atmosphere too. If you are looking for a fun night out I highly recommend Casa Del Matador! The lines can get long, though, so I recommend either going early or late to avoid the rush.\n",
            "By far the best fried chicken I have, but warning it comes with a kick. The Mac n cheese and fried okra were also very good, and the beer selection is very good. Prices good. Only prob is the typical downtown, the parking\n",

            "Our server was very helpful, recognizing that we were not familiar with the food, he gave us the information we needed to place our orders.

If I worked at mass general or nearby I would mostly eat there... Selection, price, efficiency, flavor etc is outstanding...Morning breakfast bar which turns into lunch and later salad bar is incredible!..pizza rivals the best the north end has to offer..coffee rivals Dunkin Donuts flavor!\n",
            "I had a slice of the 'Zeus' pizza.  Seriously maybe the best slice of pizza I have ever had because of the toppings and type of bread, etc.  I will definitely have to come back because I want to try out a lot more of the menu.\n",
            "The Staff, the ambiance,the food, the music!  I completely adore this place.  Any given time of the day you can just feel the flow of the environment. Not to mention an awesome hummus sandwich and please try the Broccoli cheese soup, its bowl licking good. AND they will not scowl at you for licking the bowl.  New World Deli staff and management are down to earth and a joy to have a conversation with.\n",

My younger son wanted plain bread rather than the delicious bread that they normally serve. So, he went to the restaurant next door to get bread for my son. They also brought me a nice dessert on the house for my birthday. Not inexpensive, but well worth it for the quality and convenience as we walked from the Swan hotel.\n",
            "This is one of the best restaurants in Columbus. If you are craving food that is fresh, carefully prepared, and absolutely delicious, this is the place for you. I have never had Somali food before, and I did not know what to expect. Everything I tried was spiced well and savory. \n",

            "The food was great, although more Americanized French than traditional French. I am sure the idea of a deep dish quiche would frighten most frenchies, but for me, it works great.

This fills that void nicely, and I give my kudos to the developers for risking the investment in a market that is proven to be fairly  dead (given that this is in a former wendys/tim hortons location, that speaks for itself). The market is a little meh, and the layout of the entire place is a little awkward (dining room in the front, bar and market in the back), but I can overlook that for the quality that was already apparent.\n",

There was a small issue with our order and they remade it on the spot and offered us fries and Tastykakes while we waited.  Nice guys, great food.  Homesick northeasterners, this is the spot you have been waiting for!\n",

            "Just impeccable, and easily one of the best meals I have ever had. Bumbled in just before six, as the wait staff was preparing for the slam to come, and so we and the six-odd others outside had no wait. It was a party of three, and we had no problem with the communal tables. First couple paired with us were fun. Place boasts a knowledgeable, friendly wait staff, but you are there because of the badass next to the wood stove behind the bar.\n",

            "Rabbit terrine was the standout -- a flavor, meshed with bacon, almost like a fine sausage. But so many crowded close behind. A delicious pork belly, rich sweetbreads, smart fried Brussels sprouts you pretty much have to order and airy, light fritters. A savory lamb with artichoke chipotle. The only weak spot was the fish pasta and apple, in the table's opinion, which was interesting but in our case did not quite match the stated intention of sweet and savory.\n",
            "\n",
            "Surprise of the night? Dessert. It would have been easy to cop out, after such a performance, with ice cream or something. Instead, the hazelnut chocolate crunch, with a smart honey nougat, offered the perfect cap. I will be trying to describe this meal for months.\n",
            "I love the vibe here, and their big floral wall is totally instagramable. The coffee and tea is always on point and their staff is great. My favorite is their chai latte! I can sincerely say that Presso is a favorite of mine.\n",

            "Anything on the menu is good, honestly. The only thing I am not a huge fan of is the jerusalem salad.\n",
            "This place was fabulous! We did not order a steak but had the duck papadelle (ribbon pasta) and the halibut stew dish and shared! Yum. Booth were so good! The halibut came with clams and mussels and fennel. I would order that over and over again. My youngest had the kids steak and he devoured it in 2 minutes.\n",

            "It was my last 36 hours in Boston. The grilled cheese truck was in Cleveland Circle.  I decided to skip my usual old and boring salad for dinner and try this instead. OMG. It was amazing. My friend had the Green Muenster and let me try a bite and it was like trying bacon again for the first time! I had the Med. Melt and it was also delicious.\n",
            "\n",

            "Since WaWa moved into Florida their iconic store design has been popping up raising the bar for all the tired old convenience stores.   WaWa is bright, clean, organized and offer awesome selections not even comparable to the others. The food quality exceeds all expectations based on the standards at your standard convenience store. Pumping gas is even made more enjoyable with the latest technology and piped in audio. The prices for coffee and gas are unbeatable. Love me some WaWa!!\n",

            "This place is AMAZING! The food was so good we did not even take pictures before we ate it, which says a lot!!! We got an order of \"Tiradito tricolor\" and an order of \"ceviche frito\". I have no words for how good it was, which should also say a lot. The service rivals the food  in it is level of excellence. It is family owned, and has such a warm welcoming feeling. After telling them we had never had Peruvian food, they went above and beyond to make sure we got an authentic experience. I can already tell this will be a frequent spot for us.\n",
            "This spot is my favorite incarnation of the Tacofino chain. The location has been screaming for a strong enough brand to help sustain its isolation. It is tucked away and has an intimate \"in the know\" feel.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The menu is simple but sophisticated as with all Tacofino. The lunch rush is quite an event so come a little early or wait until after 1:00 if you do not like to queue. They are very accommodating to food sensitivities...  cheesecake is a good example of something that traditionally cannot be done gluten free but they have done a deconstructed version which opens up the possibility.  Good thinking.\n",
            "Work has not allowed me to return to New England for almost four years.  My daughter and family recently moved back.  My wife and I made our first trip back this week.  I stopped at the J & M Diner yesterday.  It is every bit as amazing as I remember it.  With reason to visit New England more often, we will be back more often.  Since my last review they have gone to breakfast only, I am OK with that and they still have the pulled pork omelet.  I had it with bacon this time.  Still the best!\n",
            "What can I say about Hollerbach's? Fan-freakin-tastic. I have eaten the ghoulosh, the Reuben, the Cajun sausage, pretzel, Potawatomi pancakes, and the optimator.  I have never eaten a better potato pancake. Optimator was waaaaaaayyyyyyyy delicious. If you like spicy food then the Cajun sausage is where it is at. It is spicy and sooooooo delicious. On my way back next weekend.\n",
            "This is my favorite place in downtown hands down!! I always leave full and satisfied!! good food,great deals and friendly & fast service!!you are in downtown area looking for a place to dine in or take out i recommend this place !! They also have free cell phone charging station and free sweet tea!!\n",
            "Why pay inflated prices for breakfast sandwiches at touristy places when you can get the same at a local shop with lots of quirk. I happened to stumble in here when I was taking a walk, like any clueless tourist, in below freezing temperature. When I realized my boogers were freezing, I knew it was time to dip in somewhere to warm up. I walked in on a heated debate  between the owners and locals about politics; it was absolutely entertaining. The coffee was surprisingly good and the breakfast sandwiches were better than those at the touristy Quincy Market. I went back every morning during my stay in the North End. By second morning, they knew my name. It was like the Norm welcome from Cheers. This place is a gem.\n",
            "Pleasantly great? \n",
            "You would think its bad because of its un-primped non-frills look. But it is all about good food. Good sauce and those goooood garlic knots! We like the huge stuffed shells they make. The big guy in there is a grump and reminds me of a real New Yorker. Which adds to its charm.  Do the takeout and enjoy it at home.\n",
            "Ps- try the bruschetta!\n",
            "I went there for Buffet on a Sunday. \n",
            "I pretty much liked everything. Service was good. Parking was easy.\n",
            "The only suggestion I have for them is when they provide naan in the basket, it would be better if they can bring 2 pieces at a time so that they will not get cold pretty fast. Butter naans are fine if they are kept longer but plain naan dries up pretty fast. So only 2 pieces per person at a time (like they do it in India Palace in Union Sq)\n",
            "Java Cats is so much fun if you are looking to just chill, have a coffee or tea, and pet kitties. The staff are all super friendly and willing to help and answer any questions. They adopt out all the cats so if you find one you fall in love with you can go through the process and take home a cuddle baby. I really enjoyed my time there and the prices are reasonable. We went with a big group and it was a lot of fun. Cannot wait for their Marietta location!!\n",
            "The only thing you need to think about ordering are the Bacon-Wrapped Jalepeños. Well, and the fish tacos !\n",
            "Best Sushi place around. It is not big but who cares? Food is awesome. We had Toro included sashimi platter and who in the heck includes Toro in Sashimi platter!? Love the chef, staffs, and atmosphere. Would obviously come back.\n",
            "This is my FAVORITE neighborhood restaurant. The owner is really friendly and will talk to you about your food if you can catch him when it is not too busy. Last time I was there, my ladyfriend and I shared the beet salad, the boar and a few other things and I have been dreaming about those beets ever since. Everything I have had there, with the exception of this weird squash dish which is no longer on the menu, has been so amazing! I had a little piece of prune tart for desert and was blown away. They had dried the plums themselves! They make a lot of their own things, including pickles. I am satisfied every time I go to Navarre and love trying their continually changing menu. Highly highly recommended!\n",
            "This place is just great....they have the best subs sandwiches around at any time of the day.  Gas sometimes is higher in price than the near-by RaceTrack but just for a penny or two.   I go there often to get subs/hoagies and they have always fresh fruits at a very reasonable price and they have a fast service !\n",
            "Highly recommend it !\n",
            "Just a delight. Very relaxing and nice feel. The food and coffee is delicious. Good service too. Will definitely be back!\n",
            "I love this place, and eat here often. It is the best Mexican food I have had in Portland. I like their mojito cocktail, and adore the halibut tacos. My sweetie tends to range around the menu more, and has liked everything he is tried. The coconut creme brule is delicious. The service is great. We are regulars and they always remember our preferences. The food is clearly made with care from excellent ingredients.\n",
            "My first breakfast experience in Portland and Dots Cafe definitely set the bar high! Dark retro cafe, with outdoor seating. We had the pork benny (on a jalapeno corn bread muffin.. whaaa?!) and fried chix / waffles. Both wonderfully delicious. I am not well versed in Chix / Waffles, but I am a fan now! Only issue is they open at 10 am or something, so more of a brunch vs breakfast place. This place has your typical elevated breakfast foods, along with new twists. Great job guys!\n",

            "\n",
            "The wonton soup is also really good. I have had both the chicken and pork/shrimp and have to say both options are bomb. Seriously, drop what you are doing right now and go eat at Mama Chow's.\n",
            "Probably the best Chinese food I have ever had. Love it. Setting is casual and you never wait for a table.  I work nearby and order take out all the time too.  And I like that you can get low-carb veggies instead of rice.\n",
            "Customer service was absolutely incredible.\n",

            "Went to the Scoreboard last night for the \"pre grand opening party\" that was open to the public.  Food was great, i had the lobster mac and cheese and enjoyed a $3 Scoreboard Blue which has a nice amount of blueberries. Staff was great, our waiter was attentive without being annoying.  Place looks pretty awesome. All new everything from ceiling to floor. If you have been there before you will enjoy the new look, lives up to the \"sports bar\" name for sure.\n",
            "The service was great and the food was delicious!  We went with three adults and four kids and everyone liked their food both the entrees and the desserts. Would definitely come again!!\n",
            "Love this place!  Dumpling Daughter has become one of our go-to's in the Weston/Wayland area.  It took us a few visits to navigate the menu and discover our favorites.  The three-day pork ramen and soup dumplings are phenomenal.  Many of the menu items are fresh riffs on traditional favorites -- we particularly like the dan dan noodles, chicken katsu, and the scallion pancake beef \"sandwich.\"  As others have noted, the price point for dumplings is a bit high, but you can get a delicious dinner for a family of 3 for around $35.  Not bad at all for Weston.  We will be back again and again!\n",
            "Excited to find another \"go-to\" spot in this neighborhood. One of the pros & cons about this area is how early restaurants tend to close down at night. Fortunately the River Pig is open late, has great food (the Mac n Cheese is a must try) and the customer service is phenomenal. If you have not already, I recommend that you check this place out!! \n",

            "Amazing food, amazing atmosphere and phenomenally friendly staff! Absolutely no complaints. I have an obsession with General Tso's Tofu and this place has the best version! We also ordered the vegetarian Ma zoo Bean Curd which came with ground beef on accident (traditional Chinese dish contains meat) and when we asked about it they fixed it without hesitation. In fact the chef came out to apologize for the mix up and our wonderful waiter took the time to explain what happened. There was another version that was not vegetarian. Needless to say, it was a simply superb experience. We are smiling from our stomachs out!\n",
            "Best hand pulled noodles I have had thus far! Thick and chewy with a flavorful mild sauce.\n",
            "Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas! Smack yo grandmama, mama and friends good! The food is made to order and I can appreciate good, seasoned and hot seafood. I love their shrimp, either boiled or fried, I love it. They have a variety of choices for seasoning for the seafood that you purchase. The fried fish was ok but those shrimp, more please. I believe the customer service adds to the wow factor. The last couple of times I have been, there has been the same cashier there and the customer service that she provides is superb.  The sides that we normally get is broccoli and potatoes, we enjoy them very much. I have heard people say that the seasoning can be too much but you can always request light seasoning with no worries. I will venture out and try some other things but for now, the shrimp just calls my name............ try them, you will not regret it. A customer told me that she lived in the downtown area and really enjoyed the food so much that she travels here once a week and guess what she gets every time, the fried shrimp. We even gave each other a high five on this. Try it! PS, this is a pick up and go place, no seating to eat in but there are chairs for you to wait on your food.\n",
            "Well I wrote a review for Tensuke, so I might as well get Belle's out of the way too. Been a customer for several years now. The best way to describe it, to me, would be the classic \"French Bistro interpreted by way of Tokyo\" motif you see in various forms of popular culture or conventional travel. \n",
            "\n",
            "The baked delicacies, as I think other reviewers have attested, are top-notch. The lesser sampled food options are also equally good, but the menu timing sometimes may make it difficult to appreciate if you are in a time crunch. \n",
            "\n",
            "The service level is, to put it mildly, exceptional. The staff deserve several accolades for their professionalism and demeanor. Even in the way your cards and receipts are returned and presented to you at the end of a transaction is indicative of a company run with true Japanese cultural professionalism and decorum. This is stuff that evokes memories of Japanese language and culture classes back when I was in college. I guess I just get a small semblance of joy in remembering, recognizing and appreciating those little nuances.\n",
            "\n",
            "The coffee is very, very good. I am a particular slave to, if I am recalling this correctly, a green-tea latte of sorts. Never thought I would go for that but now it is my crack. \n",

            "Half Fast has so many options that it never gets old. And I do not think I have ever had a bad sandwich there either. The only downside is it can take a while to get your food, so do not go if you are in a rush. You can try calling ahead, but I have had varying luck with that. They also deliver, so there is that, too. This is usually the place for me and my friends to go on a lazy afternoon to get food and drinks.\n",

            "\n",
            "2.) Child friendly atmosphere. Little tables for kids, fun train set, chalk and lots of books. Great place to kill an hour or so with my little ones and maybe meet some other local parents. Great place to plan a get-together for coffee and lunch with other moms. \n",
            "\n",
            "3.) Lots of vegan options, different flavored soy cream cheeses, most of the bagels are vegan other than the obvious ones with cheese on top etc. Soy and almond milk out all the time for coffee. So much more choice than you would expect. \n",

            "\n",
            "Although it can take a bit for them to individually prepare each crepe if you do not call ahead for pick-up, the service is excellent and the food's amazing.  I will admit to having a pretty ridiculous sweet tooth, but just check out the menu and try to pretend like those sweet crepes do not have your attention.  They are surprisingly filling, everything's fresh, and even though it is already been noted, the Nutella Hot Chocolate is pure crack.  Even if you are not a fan of the original spread (you never visited your cousins in a foreign country and came home addicted?), I highly recommend it.  Hungry for lunch/dinner?  I have only tried 2-3 of the chicken crepes but those were just as delicious, and the paninis rival other places as well.\n",

The food is good but not best but who cares, it is so much fun.  The music is night club loud and you have to dance on the table with a belly dancer or join a chain of dancers around the place to get the full experience.  The service can be so so but not bad.  I cannot wait to take my kids and blow their minds!!  If you do not like loud music and cannot pry yourself from your she will then you will not like it.  Go to Applebees or something boring ;o)\n",

The food was DELICIOUS, but what was even more awesome was the ambiance. The place is small, dimly lit, but very lively. Tables were full, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. I am happy we did, because that is where all the magic happens! The chefs cook right behind the bar. Admittedly, I drooled the entire time while waiting for our food. They do give complimentary bread to start, so I did not drool for too long. :-) Overall, this is a cozy spot for an intimate date night.\n",

The Irish lamb stew (See Photo: http://www.yelp.ca/user_local_photos?select=htAj5yAttwmw52hvF2zA4A&userid=IPPkq7HtHZPx5RWRSmf9cQ) was pretty amazing actually, something I did not expect, given the huge portion came for just $7. \n",

Cooked perfect medium rare but not bloody.  Great bun to meat ratio.  Just delicious.  It did start falling apart and need a knife/fork.  The Oaxaca was also great.  Awesome flavors, though sliced avocado kept falling off.  Mashed avocado spread on would be an improvement (for ease of eating only - taste is amazing as is).  The onion rings = of the best.

She got the White Sangria, grilled cheese, tomato soup, and chocolate lava cake.  First off the service was great but the scene was even better.  The trees on the patio provide just enough shade and would make you forget that you are in the city if it was not for the skyscrapers.  Now the food.  I thought the steak was good, just on the small side as far as portions are concerned.  Their home fries were the bomb and I thought the poached eggs were ok which was kind of interesting because I have never had a poached egg before.  The french toast though, wow.  It was pretty damn amazing.  However, with how happy I was with my order, my lady had the winning plate.  They have hands down the best grilled cheese and tomato soup I have ever had in my life.  I do not even know what it is... maybe crack in the soup?  crack in the cheese?  No idea and I do not care.  I could see myself coming back here for another sunday funday brunch.\n",

The fresh guacamole is always a must. They have a variety of hot sauces to go with all the traditional Mexican dishes, which is the perfect combo. On a Saturday night if you are craving tacos in the middle of the night you can show up at 1 am. If you want a great lunch this is also your place. There has been many times that I call the order ahead. The people who work there are amazing.

            "A key, my epicurean of a father once said, in finding out if an ethnic restaurant is any true indicator of it is origin is in the quantity of the natives of it is country eating there. If you eat at Azteca Mexican Grill, you will be amazed at the number of Hispanic people that have chosen to have their dinner there as well. This, I believe, is a very good sign.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bright, happy, clean, and bustling, Azteca Mexican Grill is waited on by a staff of middle-aged professionals. It is a rambling restaurant, obviously cobbled together with add-ons dating from it is years as Iacono's (and whatever other restaurant it was before that) - it possesses the typical dropped ceiling, there is a main dining area, plus two others that seem of later construction. The chairs, the benches in the booths, all feature vibrantly painted cartoonish carvings - something my three year old son is fascinated by with every visit. Ambience suggests a tremendously casual restaurant - this is a place to talk, to eat, not to be impressed by the mood lighting, and is subsequently bright. It is a family atmosphere untinged by negativity or smacking of racism (a sad reality on both sides of the fence for immigrant and \"native\" alike) - something I cannot say for other restaurants of the same genre I have experienced in Columbus thus far. And the food? Great!\n",
            "\n",
            "My husband, my son, and I have eaten there five times at this point, all within the space of two months, so it is not quite the window on years of good experience, but so far, so good. The chips? Average. The salsa? The same. I do not understand the need others reviewing feel the need to be critical of this. Both are \"free\" and the food itself is (in my opinion, having lived in California, NC, Florida...all states with a high population of Hispanic people) delicious. The beans have that taste of authenticity - the rich touch of cream, a smattering of cheese, the rice is most obviously sauteed in butter before cooking in broth. The tortillas are store bought, not fresh, but what Mexican makes their own tortillas but the very old and the very poor these days anyway? There is a variety of meat options - not just ground, but steak, braised beef, shrimp, and the ubiquitous chicken. My husband was more than pleased with the simplicity of his pollo asado, I have never been dissatisfied with my enchiladas. The churros were light, filled with a thin line of custard, and everything a churro should be. \n",
            "\n",
            "I think 2/3 of the very subjective reviews for this restaurant are from folks that are expecting far too much of a place. Finicky, is perhaps the best descriptor. Unable to please, is another. Having experienced quite a bit of the bad of Columbus, I was more than happy to find Azteca a member of the good. Good enough to visit more than few times in the last few months and I hope it continues to be the same. Try it. Be open minded. I think you will like it :)\n",

            "What a fantastic find. This is more than vegetable rolls that we usually have at sushi places. This is a paradise. We ordered 4 rolls and now we HAVE TO come back to try the other rolls. And tomorrow he is  (Kelly) is going to put a new creation on the menu. We are coming back on Saturday.\n",
            "I am more than a little biased towards this place: I have been coming here longer than I can remember, literally. The sushi is incredibly consistent, and while not mind-blowingly high quality or terribly diverse, they cover all the staples: a good selection of uramaki, hosomaki and nigiri, with plenty of specialty roll options. Their house roll has been my long-standing favorite, despite not actually having any raw fish. The prices are fair and clearly labeled, the staff are kind and do not disturb you, and the conveyor is kept well-stocked. Additionally, the chefs are always more than willing to make you any roll you do not see out for the same price as it would be off the conveyor. They will not usually make a fresh roll if one's already out, and instead just grab the plate off the conveyor for you, but that does not bug me as much as some others.\n",

            "This place is worth the wait. It is not good for any group over 4 people. The food is very fresh. The omelets are delicious as our the pancakes and the home-fries! You will need to be patient. Everything is cooked to order.\n",
            "Mmm, yum. Ice cream.  Who does not enjoy a scoop on a hot summer day?  The ice cream here is particularly good, they are quite creative with their flavors and the service is always very friendly.  A good place to read the paper, study or to read.  My favorite is the coffee ice cream with oreo chunks....\n",

            "I tried Fleming's for the first time about a  week ago, and plan on going back very soon. My friend and I made reservations for two one Saturday night. We walked in and were greeted promptly by the hostess and the two servers standing beside her. They informed us that it would be about 5 minutes as they were just cleaning out our table which I did not mind because my friend and I grabbed drinks at the bar. The bar was a mix between casual and formal- the bartenders were quick and attentive to our needs despite the fact that the bar was packed. Soon after, the hostess walked over to the bar to inform us our table was ready.  We were first greeted by a very respectful young gentleman who did not speak much english. Afterwards, we were greeted by our server who was very on top of things throughout the night.   I ordered just a simple generic salad followed by some lobster mashed potatoes, which was really good. I really enjoyed my glass of white wine, followed by dessert.  All, in all I left in good spirits, and will definitely be back. I just hope the service and quality is consistent.\n",
            "Traveled to Portland from Sacramento for the weekend and got suggested Bijou by our hotel concierge. Did not disappoint at all! Long-ish lines due to its popularity but well worth the wait. We had the chorizo hash (needed a bit of salt but still flavorful), biscuits and gravy (a hybrid between true biscuits and gravy and eggs Benedict  - delicious!) and we shared then brioche and cinnamon French toast (large and super fluffy!)\n",

            "I have been coming to SK since the early 90's (yes, I am old) when a BF of mine worked there. The place is as consistant as the day is long! GREAT falafel, awesome baba, great hummus, and the baklava is heavenly! Add cheap prices and open late and you have got a solid winner! I make the trek to SK from suburbia as often as I can, even though the BF is no longer!  I love Shawarma King!\n",
            "Loved it! I had the brisket and pork ribs. The brisket was the BEST I have ever had, and I am fussy about my brisket! Go with the lean cut- the fatty cut is waayyy too fatty in my opinion, as well as the rest of my family's. I would skip the pork ribs next time though. They were just okay. Brisket all day, baby!\n",
            "Very impressed.  Interesting twists on menu items.  My shrimp cocktail was served as a salad, with horseradish ice cream (!) and a delectable hollandaise sauce to pour on top.  Never had anything like that--fun experience.  Main course was a brisket dish served with smoke appeal (cover was lifted at table to have smoke waft out).  Excellent.  Husband had a cured char appetizer and duck main course.  He enjoyed them so much I did not get a bite!  We split a dessert, which was a beer/banana ice cream with glazed bananas on a bed of not-to-sweet choc crumbles w/ cilantro dots for garnish.  This chef pays a lot of attention to the appearance of his dishes, and they are exquisite.  Honestly half the price I would expect to spend for quality food like this.  Next time, we are definitely going for the tasting menu.\n",

            "I was skeptical about Blue Star actually being better than Voodoo, but yes, it is true, Blue Star blows Voodoo out of the water. How do I know that Blue Star is a superior donut? I was never even tempted to get one with chocolate (my go-to) because there were so many other great flavors that tempted me. I picked the creme brulee because I am a sucker for pipettes and the lemon-lime curd. Both were amazing! Great fillings for both. Also tried the raspberry rosemary which was weird but in the most delightful way. Best donuts I have had in a long time!\n",
            "Updated because I now go here all the time for UFC events and I am always very well taken care.  It was a little dicey during college football season but somehow I still always got a table and got to see my event (although, I did get frustrated sometimes like when they had a private party upstairs where they normally show UFC and those people did not clear out until after the event had started).  But, this is still my go-to place for UFC and all sports watching.  Also, I love the $5 burger deal on Mondays because I can get a veggie burger for $5 and they have whole wheat buns.\n",

I have tried every place around here and nothing compares. I love that they have not changed a thing after all these years and the pricing is still very reasonable. Unlike the Spa which has jacked prices and has become too commercial. Keep up the good work guys!\n",

I go here way too often and every single time I am torn between ordering the Salmon Benedict and the Catfish hash, so I always make it a point to go here with a fellow Bridges Fan and order both dishes. The staff is friendly and they even split the plates with a half and half of the Benedict and Catfish hash! \n",

Bottom line, I recommend it and urge people to try it!\n",

The first is the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gao (an amazing sweet grilled pork and and a crispy eggroll over noodles and veggies). The textures and flavors in this dish are delicious.

The menu fit on a single card, but they were some of the most unique combinations and entrees I have ever seen in a restaurant. The wine selection is extensive, and the food blew me away. I had goat ribs with quinoa, almonds, and cilantro, and I would highly recommend it, although any dish sounds equally appetizing. I have a feeling that these menus change, so this restaurant definitely has return value. But why are you still reading this? Go!!\n",

I have not had a bad meal here yet.  The thing I love most about the place is the quaint, quirky  design of it.  There are crevices and corners to explore or hide in.  Whatever your choice.  The are 2 bars with tables in each area.  I am not a huge fan of when they have live music since the place is a bit small, but to each his/her own.\n",

            "Lastly, the Fried Milk dessert is one of the best desserts I have ever had.\n",
            "WORTH IT!!! I went here during the opening week and it was pretttty busy. My roommate recommended the place so I went with my boyfriend to go check it out and it was definitely as amazing as she said. The portions are a good size (great leftovers!!) and can be made to be healthy or not as healthy depending on how you are feeling that day. The staff was super friendly and were all very welcoming. You can also order on your phone if you need a quick pick up! Tuesday they have a taco deal so if you want something other than tacos I would suggest going on a different night because around 6:30pm the line goes out the door!\n",
            "My family loves Chu's .  Best sweet and sour chicken ever!  Crab puffs and egg rolls are also top notch.  Many other dishes are wonderful as well.  The orange chicken tastes like orange.  I know that is different than Safeway or whatever but try something new.  Great food.  Priced fair.\n",
            "AMAZING!!!! Absolutely a great atmosphere, mouth-watering food and friendly workers!\n",

            "Bryce Gilmore is doing some of the best-executed, most creative, most original food in this town. Paul Qui can suck it: Gilmore is the real top chef in Austin. If you like food and you live in or are visiting Austin, this is the place you need to go. Everything on the menu on any given day WILL surprise and delight you, and I have never seen such consistent, and consistently professional, staff in either the front or back of the house. \n",

            "I have had these donuts in LA and had the fortune of trying them in Portland as well. First of all, their buttermilk donuts are the best donuts that they have here! The dough is really fluffy, sweet, very rich and just a joy to eat. They have several flavors of their buttermilk donuts with my favorites being old fashioned and the raspberry flavor.\n",
            "\n",
            "The donuts are reasonably priced at around $3 - 4 each, which is reasonable for what you pay for because they are so delicious.\n",

            "They have amazing drinks! A really good selection. Excellent bartenders that are really respectful. I will definitely be back here again!! And their burgers are to die for.\n",
            "Using this review to pop my cherry on yelp. I have lived in Orlando for about 6 years and have eaten my way around this town in and out. Fine dining to food trucks and everything in between. I am a self proclaimed foodie that works in food service. I travel. I eat. \n",
            "\n",
            "Let Us get to the goods. Winnie's. Orlando's Chinese food offerings leave much to be desired. Being a Jersey boy I am always looking for good sit down Chinese. After 6 years I have finally found \"my spot\". \n",
            "\n",
            "This place looks very unsuspecting from the outside, but is very inviting when you enter the door. Tastefully decorated. Clean smelling. I was instantly excited. Greeted by my would be server I was seated quickly at a very comfy booth. The server was very playful and accommodating. I was excited to see shrimp toast on the menu and quickly ordered that as my appetizer. You can rarely find that in Orlando and I LOVE shrimp toast. As I continued to look over the menu I believe the owner came out to let me know that they were out of shrimp toast! While disappointed I was so happy to see the owner at the table and she made a few suggestions. I was heavily swayed to try the house made shrimp egg roll. Let me tell you that I do not think I could have been happier that they were out of shrimp toast. It was amazing. I make egg rolls. Damn good ones. This made me want to give up making egg rolls. As the egg rolls came out I decided on my entree of Spicy Shrimp and Chicken with cashews. They serve brown rice or jasmine rice with their entrees, but I opted for some veggie fried rice. While waiting for my food I was engaged in conversation with my server as well as another gentleman I believed to be related to the owner. Both were very funny and playful throughout my dining experience. When my food arrived there was a slight \"delay\" between the entree and the rice coming out. Maybe 5 minutes. When the rice came out she said, \"do not worry, I will get you some dessert for the wait\". The wait? Really? I was blown away. I thanked her and dug into my meal. The shrimp and chicken were cooked perfectly as were the accompanying vegetables. Just the right amount of flavorful and slightly spicy sauce. The veggie fried rice had great flavor and was not oily at all. As I was finishing up they brought me a complimentary dessert. I am not a huge fan of tiramisu, but this one was quite good. It was not house made, but very tasty for a frozen dessert. \n",
            "\n",
            "It was a little pricey for \"basic\" Chinese food, but this place is not doing anything basic. I left excited to return with a warm exit. If you are looking for sit down or take out Chinese food in the Orlando area look no further. Winnie's is knocking food and guest service out of the park.\n",
            "It was my first time trying a crepe my wonderful baby brought me here. I enjoyed every single second of it. I had the red mango with green tea ice cream. Holy shit brad Pitt! It was amazing like an orgy in my mouth, I literally wanted a second one but then I got full. Will def come back here again. -cheers, Qing Qing\n",
            "The ONLY reason I am giving this a five star review, is because our server, Katy, who was outstanding!  We ordered 2 pasta dishes which were delicious!!  But the pasta was overcooked!!  Our panzanello salad was all bread!  Little tomato and specks of vegetables!  Ordered the Bone in Ribeye, rare to medium!  It was perfect!!  The potatoes and onions were delicious!  We also looked around the restaurant and saw several light bulbs out!  Not that bad, but attention to detail!  And also, saw servers eating at the line, where food was served!  Gross!!  Other than that, the place was immaculate!!!  And our server, Katy, was superb!!!  We will be back!\n",
            "Great service. The place looked clean and tidy. I did not have to wait long for take out. I ordered the roast lamb and Kalamari dinner. The roast lamb was flavourful and tender. The Kalamari was done to perfection - very crispy and tender when I got it home. The container holding the Kalamari had a hole on top already to prevent it from getting soggy. It was more than enough for the 2 of us. We had leftovers for the next day.\n",
            "There is nothing better than a hole in the wall that can make good food. I took a chance walking into J Buffalo and I am so glad I did. I was starving and they did not disappoint. I ordered a gyro, wings and fried rice (crazy that is that is actually a combo option). The portion size was AMAZING. It was soooo much food. I was not disappointed and everything was DELICIOUS. The wings were amazing. The rice portion was overwhelming but AMAZING. And the gyro was delicious too. I cannot wait to go back this evening for more. 5 stars\n",
            "Ordered food thru UberEATS.  Absolutely fantastic. I am going to have to visit and check out the music and the rest I feel the menu!\n",
            "I love Bdubs! Garlic spicy or hot is the best for me! Great place to watch football and eat some wings with a great bar to wash it all down!  Burgers are just okay,  but the wings are delish!\n",
            "Delicious macaron and canelé. Did not try the coffee, which I have heard mixed reviews for. At 2:00 on a Sunday it was not too crowded. They had pumpkin, cassis (blackberry) and gingerbread macarons. So far I have tried the gingerbread flavor, and it is great - subtle gingery flavor, creamy buttercream in the middle that holds its own and does not squish out of the sides when you bite down. The cookie has the right texture where it kind of sticks to your teeth a liiiiitle bit when you bite into it. \n",
            "\n",
            "There were also some great stocking stuffer ideas: nicely packaged boxes of nougat, chocolate-covered coffee beans and chocolate madeline\n",
            "this place is really delicious.  Its a comfortable place to eat a hearty breakfast.  I got the Sasquatch with a smashed potato!  really nice staff, and clean place.  i recommend it for that bloody merry, biscuits and gravy kind of day.\n",
            "A favorite when in that part of town.  I was  regular long ago, so I am biased in favor of the place, and even with staff that do not know me I feel at home.  Beer prices are great, service is great and that is what matters\n",
            "This place is AMAZING, a wonderful hidden gem in Allston. The food is great and, as many have commented, the lunch specials are an incredibly good value. But the five stars is mostly about the service, which is truly the most consistently friendly of any restaurant in the area. They have always been great when I have picked up food, but a few weeks ago they went above and beyond when I dined in with my brother and sister-in-law, who were visiting from out of town. They are not huge sushi people, so the waitress carefully recommended rolls she thought they might like. When my sister-in-law did not like one of them, she brought her a less spicy version for free. And then, when they found out that I was graduating that weekend, they gave us free desserts. Like... what?!  Who even does that anymore? Seriously, just the nicest, friendliest, most wonderful people. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!\n",
            "What a great business! I only had the Granola & Fruit waffle, but it was so enjoyable. Payed $7 for the full plate and a delicious americano, too. If you are looking for a way to start off your morning, come here!\n",
            "Recently referbished. With a newly reimagined menu. Chef Tim, and the staff at Fly Fish really know how to delight. Everything at Flying Fish is thoughtfully planned out.  Flying Fish is ears above any restaurant my husband or myself have ever experienced at Walt Disney World/ the Walt Disney World resorts. Experience really is the operative word. The experience starts with a warm welcome. The kind of welcome one expects from Disney. Their energy is sincer. From there one moves into the dinning room. Blown glass flying fish and bubbles give the restaurant an elegant and whimsical feel. Even the handles of the utensils are designed to look like fish. While there is a quiet rumble, the restaurant is much quieter than others. We also dinned a Yachtsman, and it was far quieter at Flying Fish. While ambiance is important, the food is what is most important.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chef Tim went above and beyond creating this menu. Each component truly compliments the next.  We dinned here two nights, and were delited by each dish. The evening is kicked off with house baked sesame nori bread. A great crunch crust, with soft, and slightly chewy inside. The Evolution of Cheese is the perfect appetizer to begin or end a meal. Truly an evolution. The cheese is arranged in a progression of softest to hardest. A dusting of flavors, and a piece of honeycomb allows one to experience each cheese in unique ways. If the house bread was not enough, the cheese plate also comes with some house made crisps. One of the cheeses is also made in house. One does not need to like fish to enjoy a meal at Flying Fish. In fact, this was the reservation the husband was looking forward to the least. (It turned out to be his favorite.) The chefs take just as much care and consideration with their non fish entrees. Wagyu filet, bison strip loin, and duck were some of the non fish items our party enjoyed. Each was perfectly cooked to order. Great flavor combinations, and textures. Even the plating was a feast for the eyes. Being a fan of fish myself, I tried the sustainable tile fish, and sustainable striped sea bass. My favorite was the sea bass. While both were cooked perfectly, I preferred the slightly stronger flavor of the sea bass. Having little foodies in our party, we were impressed with the children's menu also being thoughtful created. Many places treat children as an afterthought. Chef Tim created a child friendly menu, that does not compromise quality. Desserts are phenomena. The hibiscus meringue that accompany the blueberry lime cheesecake were my favorite. So fragrent, sweet, and airy. I could eat them all day. The children's s'mores was reimagined in a way that elevated a campfire classic. Attached are pictures of all the desserts we ate. All were creative, elegant, fun, and most importantly delicious. \n",
            "\n",
            "Service was on point. We had the pleasure of having Stephanie serve us both nights. After experiencing her knowledgeable, warm, genuine, and attentive service, we requested her for our second visit. She showed our children the same care and respect she did ourselves. In our book that type of service goes a long way. We feel lucky to have been taken care of so wonderfully by her. She sets a high bar.  While many are wonderful, Stephanie really seems to have been sprinkled with a little extra pixie dust. \n",

            "This place was fantastic!  It was so very hard to find and we almost gave up driving around in circles as for some reason we did not notice the sign and we thought it was a free standing restaurant, not in a strip mall.  The place is not fancy inside but it is nice and clean and the bar looks cool.  I do not eat a lot of meat so I ordered the salmon and it was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the steak with eggs on top which he thought was pretty good.  I ordered the traditional lime caipirinha cocktail which I highly recommend.  It is much like a mojito.  I also got the Brazilian cream for dessert which is a cross between a chocolate ganache and a chocolate mousse.  I still crave it!  Our waiter was so nice and he explained everything to us.  He had a wonderful accent and helped me to say : Obrigado (thank you in Brazilian).  This place is authentic and wonderful.  If I ever go back to Orlando/Kissimee/Walt Disney World, I will eat here again.\n",
            "This is a five-star restaurant if ever I have seen one! Maurice, one of the owners, met us at the front door, Daniel a seasoned waiter from Hawaii, took care of us and the food was over-the-top delicious. This is not just a restaurant, it is an experience!  My son recommended this to us and we are glad that we took his advice. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the grouper with crab. Save room for dessert! We live in Tallahassee but the next time we are in Orlando it is back to Chatham's!\n",

            "After all I would recommend it since it fits the historic feel of the day.\n",
            "I love this place! The sweet corn taro fritters are a MUST for the appetizer. You cannot really go wrong with whatever you choose for your entree. My biggest problem with this place is that it is too popular! If you come even 45 minutes after opening time, expect to wait in a long line to be seated. It is definitely one of my top MUST TRY restaurants in Austin, but expect a wait.\n",

            "I have NO complaints. This is a great restaurant with close to little attitude and  pretension. It was a group of me and my girlfriends celebrating bdays. We drank alot of wine and definitely got a bit rowdy.  The staff is so nice and patient. Very accommodating and helpful. \n",

            "We ate here as part of our Disney Dining plan during our stay last week at WDW. There were 4 of us in our party and I have to say we all enjoyed our  meals immensely.  Mom had the cedar plank salmon and raved about how amazing it was. My wife had the best spicy dish of prawn and mussels.  The prawn was huge and the flavor of the rice was amazing.  My dish was the Char-grilled Buffalo Striploin Steak and it was fantastic.  I have never had buffalo before but I have to say this dish was amazing. The server recommended having the buffalo cooked medium in order to keep it tender. I am glad I followed his advice because the meat was almost melt in my mouth tender. I ate every bite, there was no fat to be trimmed away.  Next we moved on to dessert and I have got to say the strawberries and cream was the hands down favorite dessert of the table.  All of the flavors mixed together well and were a great finale to one fantastic meal. We already look forward to our next trip to Disney so we can dine here again.\n",

The food and service was so OUTSTANDING that I could not wait to return.  I am from Pittsburgh, PA and on a road trip to Treasure Island, FL we took a detour one hour out of the way to eat dinner at Dixie Crossroads.  The corn fritters are to DIE FOR and the Rock Shrimp is sweet and tender.  Our waiter was superb and even made us some fritters to go.  It is so nice to dine at an establishment with great SMILING servers, very clean inside the restaurant and above par food.  I cannot wait to go back.\n",

Also, he is on a walker, and has a hard time getting around, but they have made it easy for everyone to get out onto that awesome patio of theirs! Although the menu is not as extensive as it used to be, you will have ZERO issues finding something to nosh on here. And forget about their beer selection! Bravo! Try the Rhubarbarian rhubarb cider! Ben and I down it like it is a liquid sour patch kid (and at 6.9%, you leave feeling pretty good)! I would also like to say, that Megan is such a fantastic server, and we go back looking for her each time. Keep up the good work, and keep that Cider on tap! I am drooling just thinking about it!\n",

            "Tried this place for the first time today and I love it!!! Yummy fluffy perfect donuts that will not break the bank. It is directly across from chamblee charter high, by the way, in an unassuming little strip center. Reminds me of a donut and sandwich place out in Vegas that was equally yummy. I got a selection of a dozen donuts - plus two fritters- and paid $12 and change. Cannot beat that.  Wish these things were actually a health food because I know I will be back.\n",
            "These guys are always on time (usually deliver faster than expected ETA) and the food is delicious. I received the wrong order (one of the items was not correct) but did not think much of it - thought it was just a mistake they made in the kitchen so I let it slide. 20 minutes later, they call me again saying my order is here...OK?\n",

            "this relatively brand new place fills a much-needed space in mission hill, which has a smattering of mom and pops and a ton of chains as you get closer to the longwood medical area (LMA) and college food joints (pizza, bar food), but what it did not have prior to the introduction of milkweed was an unpretentious, food-forward, mildly moderate price point food haven that does not mind gentlly experimenting every once in a while. enter milkweed -- a location that easily piqued my interest, given my current job in the LMA, walking down tremont from roxbury crossing. what is to love? the ability for open air seating in warmer months. a humble ~10 price point for a nice variety of breakfast options that spread until 1 pm (the jersey girl in me is all hearts on this one). you want breakfast for lunch? yes, and yes, in spades. and what is breakfast? is it just pancakes? eggs? omelets? quinoa scrambles? breakfast sandwiches? pastries? the gorgeous blueberry coarse sugar-topped muffins sitting in the entryway basket that the owner made moments ago? all of this. what else? they introduce their spin on shakshuka, which i have only previously experienced at sofra (high, high bar, guys. good luck topping this one). it is a different take, perhaps with a bend into the african spectrum (there are meatballs in this one. healthy, hearty ones), served as a generous portion, with sweet and spicy red peppers and an american twist, served with toasted challah. it delivers. i have yet to visit in person but having eyed the plated portions while waiting for my takeout, it does appear that milkweed also appreciates the beauty of presentation. excited to dine in at some point soon.\n",
            "\n",
            "what else -- they serve lunch. they serve dinner. that is indeed an ambitious undertaking. so many brunchy places stick to brunch. it is a wide swath. just like it is so hard for an musical artist with a first album to serve up seconds and thirds to high acclaim -- it is all the same here.  but i am willing to check them out. this shakshuka has delivered trust. \n",

It is one of the only Italian restaurants I have been to that does not blow you away with the smell of garlic when you walk in the door haha! They have an extensive wine and craft beer menu (I tasted a new Sauvignon Blanc and it is now my favorite!), delicious food and incredible desserts....the homemade mousse was so rich and perfect. I cannot wait to return!!\n",

            "This is an intimate, unassuming restaurant, tucked away in suburbia, with outstanding food, drinks and service. The best we have had outside of Spain! It also has a surprisingly extensive vegetarian selection. It is small, and does get pretty busy, so reservations are a good idea.\n",
            "Great burger with exotic array of flavors. The 15+ minute in the 100 degree temperatures to feast on the delicious burgers and fries was well worth it! I had the Llana Poblano and my friend had the Mushroom burger. Both were incredible, juicy, flavorful and fresh. We shared the yummy, green chile con queso fries. These were spectacular. While waiting in the very friendly line, we had the marguerites that were rimmed with a unique black salt..very cool! We were lucky to be quickly seated at the bar once we got inside. The service was excellent. Our server helped us navigate the menu tremendously and provided excellent recommendations.\n",

We went last night with a group of returned peace corps volunteers to remind ourselves of the deliciousness of food from the continent and it tasted even better than the food we remembered from Zambia.  Service was fast even with a table of 12 and staff was friendly.  They also had another large Nigerian group from the Harvard business in Africa conference that looked like they were enjoying their meal and fellowship very much. I had the Teushe peanut stew with chicken and my husband had the fresh okra stew with goat and they were both excellent.  The jollof was also quite good.\n",

Hopdoddy's did not disappoint. As usual, the food was incredible and the beer-ritas (I forget what they are called here) were excellent!

It was slightly spicy, and when blended all together, it was so good and the portions were just right. My husband got the Fricasee, which included poached eggs, short ribs, potatoes and sauteed onions. The short ribs on that dish was to die for.

They have pool tables, lots of seating on the outside of the theaters, nice, clean restrooms...worth every penny!\n",

The Robin Hood sandwich and the au gratin potato cake were delicious. Well seasoned and thoughtfully prepared. If I was local, I would  be a regular! Thanks for a great meal!\n",
            "A real surprise. We ended up getting appetizers, which were $35 for 2 big eaters, and we could not finish. Attentive service, and a belly dancer! Food was excellent. Only complaint was that we seemed to run out of the pita's earlier than they could bring more, but I would not let that get in the way of 5 stars.\n",

            "Great food. I have tried noble broccoli, hot & sour soup, flan, wonton soup, udon soup, sweet and sour \"chicken\", chow mein, and a salad. All was amazing! The man is very nice. However, he kept yawning very loudly in the dining room which is quite unprofessional but I still love it there nonetheless. I would highly recommend this place. It is great for anyone, not just vegans/vegetarians. I do believe it is one of the most underrated vegan restaurants in Portland. My non-vegan mom and grandma love it so we go here every time we are in Portland!\n",

Individual soy creamer packets are awesome.  I just keep them in my purse.  I also indulged in some vegan caviar.  Not sure if it will be good but the fact that I can get it here is the coolest thing ever.  I wish Food Fight could expand and open where I live.\n",
            "One of the best spots in winchester/woburn for subs.  Mike the owner is a classy guy and his staff are great as well.  They always know Ricky wants that Swamp Thing at least once a week for my fix.  If you do not know about the Swamp Thing then you better ask somebody.\n",
            "Start, warm friendly place. Comfortable seating. Super good coffee. Standard order of eggs, hashbrown, and toast proved to be much better than standard. Recommend Hen House breakfast. Eggs cooked to perfection. Best hashbrowns ever. The bacon was some of the best I have ever had. Try the biscuit instead of toast. The wait staff takes after Morton's. That made for a very nice breakfast. The only downside is that this place is roughly 30% more than other breakfast places. Breakfast for two, with tip came to $42. But it was worth it. I will be back when I can afford it.\n",
            "Had Cafe Josie for our Valentines Day dinner. The atmosphere was not too formal/not to casual. The only menu being offered was the 'Experience Menu' which I thought was a good way to try different things. We had about 10 dishes - fried oisters, Brussels sprouts, calamari, srimp, pork loin, Mac and cheese, fried chicken, and the brisket which was our favorite!\n",

            "Solid neighborhood spot with great live music.  There is normally free music or trivia early with a later show at a great price. The beer tap list is solid, covering everything from sours to IPAs and the bar is ready to rock you with intricate cocktails. Come and get some!\n",
            "I am a steak snob who has never felt I was getting a 5-star steak from anywhere in the world apart from Prime in Las Vegas. Every restaurant in Austin I have ever been to serves steaks that, even if flavorful, are not anything I could not do at my own house for 1/4th of the price.\n",
            "\n",
            "That was NOT the case with the bone-in ribeye I had on Valentine's day. Eddie V's is bold in their seasoning choices, but artful in that you are not tasting the seasoning, you are tasting the steak. Cooked perfectly rare, the center of the steak was like warm butter. \n",

We were seated right at our reservation time, we had wonderful service throughout the meal, and everything we had surpassed our lofty expectations. My Caesar salad was fresh and exploding with flavor and even a little kick. The truffle mac and cheese was so good we almost ordered seconds, and the au gratin potatoes were rich and creamy.\n",

But nothing I have tasted here (or anywhere, really) compares to White's strawberry and whipped cream cake that my family orders for birthdays throughout the year.  It is the BEST. CAKE. EVER. I plan my annual summer trip home around a birthday just so I know I will have some!\n",
            "I always pass by this place on my way home and tell my husband that we should eat here some day. What attracted me to this place was the huge parking lot and all the people that go in there. I knew that it had to be good. Today I got home and there is was on my kitchen counter, a surprise pizza. I grabbed a slice pizza with one hand while holding my purse on the other hand. My expectations were met. This is an awesome pizza!! The best pizza I have ever had.

The portions are generous too.  If you order off the specials board, a free side is included! I had a buffalo chicken wrap, and would have never known it was meatless. So good! And I chose a Cubano soup for my side, which was hot and perfectly prepared-the flavor and texture-just delicious.\n",

Unique flavor combinations and everything carefully prepared. Appetizer of olives for example are warm and infused with rosemary. Pizza is amazing - elevated to a higher level with fresh dough and interesting combinations. Quality of cheese in all dishes is fantastic. Highly recommend.\n",

            "You can also order coffees, lattes and waffles while you wait.  I got a lavender latte because I have never heard of this before.  It was flowery and sweet, as you would expect.  Very smooth, if I am allowed to start throwing wine adjectives.  Not sure I would get it again, but definitely interesting and different.  My date had the pistachio rose-water hot chocolate.  The rose-water was very noticeable.  I liked this beverage better.  But both were sweeter than what I am used to.\n",

            "Have not eaten in at Goldies' in a long long time, this place never ceases to amaze me.  In fact this place is SOOOOO good that when I used to go Tunnel Club across the street, I would leave every hour or so, come here grab a slice of pizza, grab a beer, then go back to Tunnel.  Remembering this, I decided to order a pizza from them last Saturday, and I was once again reminded why I have always considered this place to be the best pizza joint in town...the large we ordered turned out to be like an extra extra large, fed 5 of us no problem, tasted like heaven.  The only thing I wish Goldie's would change is allow for further delivery even if that means they have to increase the charge of delivery.\n",
            "This place is great, could not fault it. The staff were friendly and more than helpful. Just grabbed a slice and a salad but was really impressed. Everything was super fresh, the pizza sauce is awesome and it all came out really fast. This place is on point.\n",

            "\n",
            "No choices, other than checking on any food allergies.  You are there to pick your beer/wine and get fed.  Good timing between courses,  Pretty much the same short pause between each course.  14 courses in just at 2 hours felt like a pleasant relaxed and not too long dinner, and the courses though small were enough to feel like we would had a solid meal by the end.  \n",

            "\n",
            "We had the calamari appetizer and started with a bottle of wine.  For entrees, my wife had hand-made lobster ravioli in a red sauce and I had venison scallopini in a Creme de Cassis and orange sauce.  Both were simply amazing.  We were floored with the quality of the food and the presentation.\n",

I know we started out with some type of nacho appetizer, that was good and then for my entree I got the chicken mac and cheese, it was DELICIOUS!!!! Believe I added bacon to mine and that just took the dish to another level. I ordered some cornbread after looking over at my Aunts plate. The cornbread was perfection, it was moist, buttery and I think it was sweet. When I am in the area I will be making a trip back here. Our waitress was great and the staff very pleasant. I thought it was so cute how the hostess were dressed as news reporters I think. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n",
            "Their hard cider fritters and Mexican Hot Chocolate doughnut are amazing. I will admit, I had sort of drug my feet about going here. All the hype just made me worried that it would not be all its cracked up to, but they are sticky, sweet, super flavorful and so very fresh. I do not tend to crave sweets, but when I do, this is where I go. They have a lot of inventive flavors, and there is not usually a huge wait to get it. I definitely would not mind coming back to try something else.\n",
            "Also, just a side note. I paired the Mexican Hot Chocolate doughnut of magic with Laurelwood brewing's, Space Stout. So. Freaking. Good.\n",
            "their food is solid.  Get the 3 cup chicken, it is simply amazing, it comes out in a clay pot that is piping hot.  Their Sichuan fish is good, mildly spicy but the tofu in this dish was simply breath taking.  Their tripe was very fresh, the salt and pepper fish is a must try.  Make sure you hit this place before or after lunch, it gets a bit busy.  \n",

Being from Karachi, Pakistan, I feel like Malik Saheb's food reminds me of food back home.  My top favorite items on the menu are Chicken Karahi and Chicken Achari.  The ambiance and service are okay but the food is spot on!!!!  If you want to try Good authentic Pakistani food, try this restaurant.\n",
            "Best. Donuts. In. Portland!!!!! These are amazing. The actual donut is just divine! That is how you know a donut is great, it is not just the incredible toppings but the donut itself. The blueberry was a favorite and the maple bacon, which is always my go to, was hands down the BEST maple bacon I have ever had. That says a lot considering I have tried dozens of maple bacon donuts across the US.   The employees were also very kind and patient as I picked which flavors I wanted. Go here!!!!! You will not be disappointed.\n",

If you are really hungry or want to be able to take home lunch for the next day, get the milanesa or lomo sandwich.  I have had the shepard's pie when it was on special, it was rich, thick, meaty and tasty. I have had nothing mediocre. Just do it!\n",

Cool place to chill at. The have TVs surrounding the bar. During the day it is hard to view the TVs outside due to the glare.\n",
            "I had tried this restaurant over a year ago and was not super impressed with the food then. But they renovated the  interior and they must have changed chef/ menu since  because I was pleasantly surprised at quality and taste of each dish. They have a great , inexpensive tapas bar menu. I tried the calamari, spinach dip and wedge salad at around $5 each and they were nicely presented and delicious. \n",
            "But what I recommend most is the natural chicken pizza. Easily 1 of top 3 pizzas I have EVER had!! It was an amazing thin crust with unusual but perfectly matched toppings, and I would order it every time.\n",
            "To top it off the vanilla bread pudding for dessert was awesome. One of the best I have ever had and it was large enough to share.\n",

            "Great addition to Smyrna! Finally a place that actually has quality ingredients! Please be aware this is not your standard garbage Subway where they serve 12 inches of poison, here you get the correct portion we should be eating along with natural and organic and more importantly NON-GMO products. The sandwiches we had we fantastic and we will be back. Keep up the great work!\n",

            "The best Greek food in Orlando. Great show, dancing, hot meze, cold meze, the most fantastic hummus anywhere and ditto for the spanakopita. If you like salty hot cheese, try the flaming saganaki. The hot or cold meze platter gives you a chance to try several items. The lamb is great, as is the gyro meat, the chicken, souvlaki, taramosalata, you cannot go wrong. Several fish and seafood entrees, tzatziki, fresh soft pita breads, and throw the napkins in the air like you just do not care......Opa!\n",

            "Delicious food. I have yet to find an entree that I did not like. My girlfriend and I live in the area and stumbled on this place by accident. We were a little apprehensive at first, but I am so glad we went in to try it out. The pad thai is the best I have ever had. And the woon-sen soup is also a favorite. There is an awesome lunch deal with a free appetizer buffet. I have never been disappointed with the service, or with the quality of the food.\n",

This place specializes in selling various types of tofu soup and sizzling Korean BBQ plates. I always like to get the Kimchi Beef Tofu Stew medium spicy with the BBQ Chicken. Both are deliciously satisfying. A lot of my friends like the Kalbi over the chicken but I am not a fan of biting meat off bones so chicken for me! \n",

            "Anyway, the tofu stews here are perfectly seasoned and flavors are all on point. The meat is equally as good but I would not recommend the bulgogi. If you are craving beef go for the Kalbi, otherwise get the BBQ chicken. I also love the banchans here. There is always so many options and like most Korean restaurants, FREE REFILLS! Ooh. One more thing you MUST try. Not many people order this here but TRY THE DUKBOKKI!!! I swear Kaju makes the BEST dukbokki in Boston. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly spicy. Mmmm. Delicious. \n",

It was late in the evening and decided to call in.The front desk said Happy Buddha is the only Chinese restaurant that delivers.Frankly after reading the reviews we were a bit reluctant but decided to give them a try.\n",
            "We are happy that we did that.The owner herself came to deliver and it was within half hr. All the food was tasty and delicious. They used a lot of Mushrooms, Bamboo shoots, onions which gave the food a good flavour.Even provided plates, forks and condiments as requested.\n",

            "Their food definitely deserve a 5 star rating.\n",
            "Decided to head down here on a whim for lunch. I work downtown so it was already a convenient location. The food comes out fast. Think of this place as a quirky schlotzsky's style sandwich place. You walk in and are greeted by a chalkboard menu filled with mostly sandwiches and quesadillas. Order, grab a number and sit anywhere. The sitting area is actually underground. You have to head down a short staircase and it is actually a lot roomier than you would expect.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food was good. Tasted fresh. It is a little more expensive than a regular sandwich place, but I really liked the food. I had the Chipotle chicken sandwich. I would say it was worth the walk over to 17th from campus. Most importantly it was fast. In and out quickly.\n",
            "Great casual atmosphere, and attractive staff.  I ordered enchiladas, which came with an amazing salad!  Definitely coming here again.\n",
            "We decided on this restaurant through Scoutmob and purchased the deal for a last minute Friday night date. We have driven past the place a few times and, while it looks kind of out of place for Sandy Springs, we loved everything about it.

            "A+ soups and wonderful sandwiches with the best bread! I noticed on another review someone RAVED about their negative experience; Life is not perfect and the best of places make mistakes or lapses in communication but that does not make them racsist. This is a very small restaurant that has a far better chance of surviving if there is no food waste; They will often run out of food very early in the day and it is therefore recommended that you call first thing in the morning....or even the day before and have your food order held for you; no doubt those people who were served their soup to go had prearranged it; It did take me 1 or 2 times there to learn the house guidelines but that can be the fun part of a new experience. The easiest thing in life is to stand at one vantage point and declare you see everything clearly. the opposite of anger is patience; This place has great food with a well meaning staff so you might want to check it out for yourself,   we are so glad we did.    Billy & Patricia H\n",
            "I have eaten lunch here three or four times over the past year and I love it. Their sandwiches are drool worthy, their pastries are waaaaay above average, and one time I had the most fantastic pasta alla bolognese, which surprised me because that is a tricky one and it is not even an Italian restaurant. The ambience is what you might expect behind a place like Rejuvenation Hardware -- rustic and vintage-y. Notice the preserved tile mosaic on the floor. Reminds me of Pompeii. And the natural lighting coming in the windows is very pleasant, and it is nice and quiet. For some reason, it does not seem to get noisy, even with several tables occupied. They also have a cool wooden counter against the windows, which is helpful if you are trying to focus on something, or if you are there alone. Yesterday I went there with my partner and after lunch I had the best mocha I have ever had in my LIFE. with almond milk. That alone would be worth going there.\n",

Totally saved my butt when I needed to feed 5 hungry systems engineers. Thanks Cappys!\n",

They can make a break a New England menu! They passed! And frankly they were EPIC. Seasoned just enough, perfectly cleaned and every she will had something to offer. As far as the bacon battered hush puppies... Well just read that again and you cannot not order them.  I repeat: BACON BATTERED HUSH PUPPIES.\n",

            "\n",
            "Carpaccio, super light, fresh. Just overall has a bright flavor, great if you want to cleanse the pallete. \n",
            "\n",
            "Uni nigiri, if you have been on the fence about uni with people saying it is super salty like the ocean, try it here. I think it still has that salt water like flavor but not as intense. And the best part is that it is super creamy and melts in your mouth. And ittoku piles it on!\n",
            "\n",
            "Takowasa was kind of a fun dish to try. It is raw octopus in a wasabi based sauce, but it worked. At first, I got this peppery like sensation that you get from wasabi but the raw octopus had this sweetness that mellowed it down\n",

            "Loved this dinner!! We got a spot right next to the kitchen and loved watching them prepare the oysters and other food. The food was absolutely excellent and the service was great too. Best branzino I have ever had and the oysters were yummy too. This place will be a must visit next time we are in Boston!\n",
            "So excited to see Sancho's opened their restaurant here. It is probably the best place to eat around. Great food and fast authentic Mexican food. One thing, I wish, and I know many people feel the same way, is to be opened for dinner as well. With so many people around here, I am sure they would do great. Maybe test it out guys! Nothing to loose ;)\n",

            "I love this MM! Staff is always great- helpful, timely. The food is fantastic. The fact that there are SO many vegetarian options on pizza is great. And they have so much more to offer than your typical toppings (tofu, avocado, etc). There is plenty premade options to choose from, or you can get creative and select what you want for a build your own. Their crust, by the way, is quite flavorful! \n",

            "This is one of my all-time favorite sandwich places.  Fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients, plus fair prices and friendly service.  My favorite is the mozzarella & tomato.  Their muffins are delicious, as are all of their baked goods.  And they have a station where you can get a piece of bread or pastry to try.\n",

            "Update, 6/12/2007: Still as good as ever, however, they do not serve Cape Cod chips anymore :(, but make up for it by serving Izzy drinks, which rock.  Also, tried the chicken noodle soup this winter, was very fresh & flavorufl.  However, they have \"People love us on Yelp\" sticker.  So awesome!\n",
            "We had not been here for quite awhile and decided to stop in.  Everything was excellent!  For appetizers, we took advantage of the 1/2 price happy hour to try the pretzel bites and reuben rolls; both were wonderful.  For entrees, we had the spicy chicken penne and the urbanator steak burger.  Again, both were the best.  Good food, good atmosphere, highly recommended.\n",

From the time we were seated to the time we left we were treated very well, even though it was very busy our server, Shannon took time to go over the menu with us and make suggestions. I had the Singapore Noodles and my boyfriend had the Kennedys Meatloaf. Both were very tasty. The General Manager, Zach, stopped by to check on us to see how our dinner experience was going, and I thought to myself Wow! When was the last time a General Manager to the time on a busy night to go around to each table to check on each guest! If your in the area you should definitely check out this hidden gem!\n",

            "Have not been in for a while, but as usual the food is amazing! Plus the service is what brings me back, food being a close second lol. The greeter (did not catch her name) was very friendly, and David (who took my call) covered all the bases from utensils to bringing my food instead of just leaving it and calling my name.\n",

            "I also like the fact that they never push you out the door even if the place is full (which it usually is) - they make you ask for the check, very cool. I love it there.\n",
            "The kid's menu pizza is a great value and you cannot argue with a playground to keep them entertained. The best part of the meal was our service. Rylee greeted us with a smile, seated us immediately and then proceeded to provide excellent service.  Thank you Rylee!\n",
            "Had the food bar and the meat buffet. The salads were good as well as the hot food. The meats were out of this world good. I had to limit myself to be able to sample everything. The only thing that I did not have was the chicken sausage.\n",
            "Oh Prezza, how I love you!  I went here last night and got a seat at the bar with my bf. I have always sat in the dining room and was kind of skeptical about sitting at the bar for dinner but it was great! The bartender Lisa was outstanding and very friendly. We started with the short ribs and half order of pumpkin lobster ravioli both wonderful. I had the crispy pork chop stuffed with fontina cheese, yum! For dessert (oh yes I order dessert) I had the tiramisu parfait which is a must!  All in all you cannot go wrong when ordering at Prezza! The atmosphere and food is always superb!\n",
            "I was craving noodles and Googled a place, this one came up and I am so thankful! I really cannot comment on the authenticity oh how they are made but I can say they are so delicious. Seeing other tables food, all the dishes looked appetizing and good so I was so undecided. I order a pretty traditional noodle soup and some dumplings...amazing!\n",
            "The place is spacey and clean and the staff was fantastic! Would definitely return!\n",
            "All-around excellent. Very pretty interior and good ambiance. The food is great (I got the pad thai) and I have never had spring rolls as delicious or presented with such class as at L'Thai. Each is served in an individual glass holder with sauce. Perfect.\n",
            "Loved it!!!!  Had the Cajun Queen Pizza. Really good. Great service and FABULOUS PIZZA! !!\n",
            "If you are having German beer and not having sausage you are doing it wrong. Be sure to look across the parking lot upstairs. Wursthaus has a great view of the mountains across the river, the same awesome beer as the tasting room, but with the bonus of amazing German food.\n",
            "This place is totally delicious and reasonably priced, especially the happy hour prices. My girlfriend and I come here fairly regularly and keep coming back for a reason! We love that it is open late and has really tasty and innovative sushi rolls, in addition to an expansive and unique blend of menu items from many regions. I am pretty sure there is nowhere else can you get this kind of quality dining after 10pm in Austin!\n",
            "We came here for wine. Solely for wine, so this is not a food review. The wine was tasty, and the service was great. The bartender/waiter was very knowlegable and gave us some nice tastings of a few wines to help us make decisions. Good prices for glasses of wine. Will be back and hopefully for food too. It smelled delicious.\n",
            "I have gotten smoothie bowls from here two days in a row. It is my new obsession! My favorite so far has been the Orlando Magic Berry Bowl. I added granola to it. It was the perfect light dinner. They also deliver through Uber Eats which is convenient. \n",

            "A dear friend treated me to dinner here last night, and it was from start to finish truly a great experience.  The server described the menu as \"Italian/New American\" and consisted of small plates, i.e. tapas-style, and recommended sharing the array of flavors and textures.  While the overall cost of obtaining several plates pushed the bill upward, it did not seem too terribly high in my opinion for such great tasting food, presentation and service to say nothing of the pretty ambience.  We were never rushed when pausing to choose additional plates, received great recommendations and the delivery times for our dishes were spot-on.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our food favorites included:  the Puffy Potatoes, Sunchoke, Thin Pasta (with truffle oil), Pork Belly, and the Duck.  Everything delivered to the table was served perfectly hot and beautifully plated.  Savory dishes were nicely balanced between salt and sweet.  As for cocktails, the Showtime -- a bin-based drink -- shined brightest for my tastes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the overall bill this is not a place I could highly frequent, but I did not leave feeling the value/experience ratio was off at all.  I have dined at other upper-end establishments with small plates that did not come close to the flavors and presentation of Juniper.  I will definitely return.\n",
            "Five star rating is due to going well above and beyond service wise. The food is good for the price and the overall atmosphere is actually really nice. Happy hour is also pretty phenomenal with really good deals.\n",
            "Coming from the South as I do, I had to appreciate the authenticity of the food, the drink, and the decor at Southland Whiskey Kitchen.  At the hospitality of the hostess and server, and it is a perfect match for a sunny afternoon.\n",

            "Do not skip the shrimp and grits! They are wonderful. The fried chicken is delicious, if a bit on the salty side.  Will have to come back to try more items, and we will do that.\n",
            "Really good consistent and fast service. The flavor of the broth is really good and always hits the spot. Plenty of everything in the soup - noodles, meat, tripe, etc. some other places I have noticed seem to Be skimping...\n",
            "Imani (bartender) is the absolute best! I was very pleased with all of her recommendations and quite pleased with the drinks she made.  Every time someone comes into to town we make a CowFish stop.  My last guests brought children who were served bento boxes with the cutest rice crispy/sweetish fish treat on the side. I loved the service as well as the music!\n",
            "Love this place. I swear it feels like home. The food is cooked fresh so it take a little bit but not to long. The Embilta special is great to share. The owner is welcoming and always kind. I choose this spot over some of the more popular spots in Atlanta any day.\n",
            "Large variety on tap with staff ready to help you find what is perfect.  Not a huge variety of bottled beers however what waS there gave good variety.\n",
            "We moved to Medford, a short walk from Lantana's. As service there tends to run on the slower side, do not go there if you are in a hurry to get somewhere afterward.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The food there is great, and there is a decent selection of entrees.  Be sure to request their bread and dipping oil (some of my fave!).  In addition, the pumpkin ravioli, steak tips, fried artichokes are some of our faves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Love their Sunday brunch as well.  The husband and I are definitely regulars there at this point.  I have upgraded this place to 5 stars. Love it.  And they serve wine and beer!!\n",
            "My co-workers and I love this spot! This is a real honest-to-goodness great lunch destination run by people that appreciate cooking good food for people. The pastrami burger is by far the best but the NY dogs are amazing as well. Anyone I have ever sent here always comes back with a smile on their face. \n",
            "For anyone to say that poor hygiene is an issue is grossly exaggerating and is probably not used to going anywhere but trendy hipster restaurants. To them I say go wax your mustache and moisturize your tattoos somewhere else! \n",
            "The cook always wears gloves, checks the temperature of all the food they cook, and has a solid sanitation process in line for all the cooking utensils.  Better hygiene than I have seen at a handful of food trucks in town by far.These are great people deserving of business that just make great food.\n",

The bathroom tiles are unique and the beat thing about this co-op being locally owned and NOT a corporation owned by some elitists. Love the products offered, all the bulk and spices, teas etc. \n",

It is all about quality traditional sushi and NOT like places to offer fancy sushi with different types of sauce on it (to taste like fast food) and luxury decorations with truffle on the top.\n",
            "If you want good old-fashioned Italian working class pizza in an authentic local hangout, this is just The Best in Boston. When the craving for that style of pizza hits, I will drive halfway across town for it and be happy I did!\n",
            "\n",
            "Why is Santarpio's so special? Well, first, most pizza in town is Greek. The crust is tasteless and doughy, the cheese is low-quality and congealed in a giant layer over the marinara. You can just peel the cheese off the top and there is the layer of marinara under it, which by the way, tastes terrible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the worst Italian style pizza, which is harder to find, is better than Greek pizza. In Italian style pizza, which some people also call New York Style, the crust is just right--pretty thin, but does not  need to brag about being thin like the gourmet places...it just is. The crust is just crunchy enough, with delicious marinara and gooey high-quality mozzarella in just the right proportions. So when you look at the slice you see spots of white and spots of red. This is the class in which Santarpio rules. Just rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "And then there is  frou-frou gourmet type \"thin crust\" type pizza. The crust is maybe even a little thinner than good Italian pizza and--in the best ones--may be yeastier and more flavorful. The style is a little different--proportions of ingredients may be a bit inventive depending on the chef and the sauce may vary--say fresh tomatoes instead of marinara. In this class, the best in town are Upper Crust (in Brookline and now other locations) and Sweet Tomatoes in Newton.\n",
            "\n",
            "I like the frou-frou stuff, but every now and then I am jonesing for the best in working-class Italian style, and that is when I head to Chelsea Street. Cannot wait to try the new location on Route 1 when it opens....stopped by a few days ago and it was still under construction.\n",

My companion and I ordered 2 different cocktails each. We followed the charming bartender's advice on using a spicy vodka in the cilantro-lime or pineapple(?) cocktail, and it was exquisite. The three other cocktails that I tasted were similarly spectacular.  I recommend chatting up the bartender and following her recommendations after sharing your particular flavor preferences.  I did not taste any of the food, so I cannot comment on the food offerings, but the service and beverages at the bar were out of this world.\n",

It was great, not too oily, creamy, spicy, and just overall delicious. The lamb was cooked perfectly, and the Malai Kafta was flavorful and moist, generous size. The nan was also pretty great, 2 big pieces per order, soft and fluffy.\n",

Crawfish gumbo I would like to get if I ever go back to Austin.I loved the spicy kick the  Crawfish beignets had after you bit into . it.  Bread pudding...was perrfeeect.  I hope I go back to Austin, because you better bet I will be at the french quarter grille.\n",

From the crispy lobster tail appetizer to the sea bass special entree and the chocolate cake desert, MAYA left an exceptional unforgettable taste in my mouth.

I tried making them at home to see if it was just my unknown love for gcs, but then I went again! Every time, my mind was blown!!! Good stuff, great place! Love it!\n",
            "I took a friend out for a birthday dinner here on Monday (1/29/18) and our reservation was at 9:15pm and we arrived a tad bit late at 9:20pm (Downtown Parking). But despite being late we were welcomed and seated right away, it was a Monday night so they were not incredibly busy. Because the restaurant closed at 10pm, I thought for sure that we were going to get sub-par service (bad experiences) and that who comes in 40 minutes before closing look but the service was great and the food was even better. I highly recommend the grove to anyone looking for a good downtown Italian meal and an extensive wine list. Will for sure be back!\n",

Other ales at lunch wee their Pilsner which was really good & their Scottish Ale.  All pictured - Christmas Ale is the darkest.  Our table had 4 of their sandwiches all of which were great served with homemade potato chips, potato salad, cole slaw or macaroni salad.  If you get the chips add a side of their homemade chip dip. Only thing that could be construed as a negative was the container for the potato salad, it was smaller than liked because it was sooo good.\n",

There is nothing fancy or inventive about their food but the cooking execution is what puts them on top. The space is small and intimate there is a YOU shaped bar in the middle, the side has some tables and the far left has some booth seating. Seating is pretty intimate here. Lighting is low and there is jazz playing in the background. \n",

Very small and 'cute' for a somewhat gross Allston area filled with bars and stores no one remembers. Get a few drinks at a nearby bar before/after and go with Fish Market for food. You will not regret it.\n",

At the end you have exactly the sandwich you ordered. truthfully I did not expect much but my sandwich was FULL of meat!  They were not cheap at all with the fixings either.  Needless to say i was full after this meal.\n",

            "That said, I often find Helser's to be 15-30 mins shorter on wait than some more trendy or hip establishments nearby. That is not to say Helser's does not have its own diner-esque charm, and for the price, the food is as good as any in the area.\n",

No, no. What I got was a 15 min wait, and a tasty breakfast.\n",

The staff are super friendly, and they have an adorable little patio in the back which is great when the weather is nice.  This is my favorite coffee shop in Boston!\n",

I ordered the green chicken enchiladas, as I use that as a gauge for determining flavor at all Mexican restaurants.  It was good,  a little on the dry side. This was the first time I ordered chorizo con queso. Sooo good. The birthday celebration was a nice surprise with the employees coming out and singing,  they also brought a sweet banuelo type dessert.

Do not get me wrong, the food is great. But the staff have treated me like family. As far as the food goes, I have not had one thing here I did not like. Omelettes are great. The specials are always good. A favorite is the chicken avocado grill. I get it as a wrap and add onions and bacon. Too good. They are still fairly new in the neighborhood. They have been here since April of last year. But they stay busy. Free parking in the Brookwood Marketplace parking garage. Stop by and get a skillet and a smile.\n",

I started out with the wood-fired avocados (my mouth is watering thinking about them right now), and then split a salad and pizza with my friend. We topped off the meal with their freshly made gelato. YUM! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and cannot wait to go back. I have a feeling it is going to be a weekly stop for me and my friends!\n",

Be forewarned that during peak brunch hours you may have quite a bit of a wait if you do not get there early. The food is delicious (the apple fritters are a must have) and I always find something different that makes me happy. This morning I had a bit of a slip with my eggs Benedict but they were very nice and quick to bring me out a new one, and honestly the great service just makes me like them more. Great place.\n",

And decent people work here---Thank YOU BK!!!\n",
            "This Sushi eatery was amazing although some rolls did not make it to my mouth in a full piece but they were still delicious. I came with 11 people and the place was packed but we were seated shortly after arriving. Our food came in less then about 15 minutes and was still fantastic! The food was not the only thing that was great the service was great too! Everyone was so nice and polite and when they forgot to bring something we asked for they greatly apologized, I give the service 5 stars! I would totally recommend coming here if your looking for some great sushi for dinner.\n",

There home made chips are excellent, the pecan encrusted talipia sandwich is awesome, the buffalo chicken paninni was wonderful and the lava cake is one of the best I have had !!! Lots of beers are on tap for an excellent assortment to order from.  The restaurant is very nice, clean, and cozy feeling for a bar a very hip place, with an nice assortment of ages at the bar area.  This place is a must !!!\n",

The food and service were both amazing; we were running late due to traffic and the host moved our reservation back without any hesitation.\n",
            "As much as I like to shake things up and check out new spots, my friends and I always end up at Oba for happy hour (if you show up on Sunday you can feast on their happy hour specials all day long)!  Not only does the menu offer incredible food and drink deals ($2-$5 large portion appetizers/$3 wine/$5 cocktails), but the ambience is festive and swanky no matter what time of day. It is one of those places that has the perfect music and mood lighting to make you feel absolutely sexy...or maybe that is the 3-buck wine talking???\n",

            "No joke, I eat here 3+ times a week. This is hands down the best sushi I have ever had, every time I come in. They have the freshest fish - seen them cutting a whole tuna behind the sushi bar.  The service is great, and the owner, Mark, is wonderful! Always chats with me when I come in alone and makes my husband and I feel right at home every time we come in. I have celiac's disease and they have never failed to accommodate me and my allergy. Gluten free soy sauce is available and almost every sushi roll can be made gluten free - even the AMAZING lettuce wraps can be made gf! \n",

We had thought there was prix fixe menu as we thought we saw this on the website, but no such luck. Three of us had the eggs Benedict which were melt in your mouth good, and also the croissant which was crispy and delicious. Juan was our server and was so friendly and nice, great great service.

Your hands will get sticky, because the white chocolate will run down the sides like it was carefully dipped (or was it poured on?). I wonder where they got the white chocolate from, because when you add that on top of their already incredible Belgian waffle, you have got a waffle worth saving in your pocket and taking it with you wherever you go; whenever you feel hungry, or in a content mood, take a bite and you will feel fulfilled - perhaps adventurous.\n",

            "The owner, Damien I assume, corrected me with \"How good are they\" when I asked \"How big are they?\". They are about the size of a burger - the width, I mean. This is the best comparison I can come up with, right now, but just believe me when I say get at least two or three.\n",

            "Great suggestion for like a third date. We loved this place! A great choice for a nice dinner, but not so nice that someone like me could not eat there lol... We had the veggie plate and the swordfish. The food was great, and the staff is friendly. It is not a swanky/trendy spot, just a gem of a spot to have a great dinner. We will be going back and I recommend you do too.\n",

            "Favorite local restaurant, hands down! I first came to Gourdough's last year when I visited Austin for the first time. I bit into the Breast Lift sandwich, looked up at my boyfriend and said \"I am moving to Austin!\" Little did I know I would actually move AND come back to Gourdough's within a week of moving. Gourdough's has a way of making dough incredibly appealing. Whether it is used as the buns of a sandwich or as the base for a yummy dessert, they know what they are cookin'. My second time here I ordered the Fredericksburg Mule, The Big Cheez, and the Sin-A-Bomb. This place does not disappoint. Everything I have ordered, or stolen from my boyfriend's plate, has been delicious. \n",

Their smoothies are also very good as well as their vegan popcorn! Highly recommend if you like fresh food that is even better for you!\n",

            "I came to this panera to enjoy a hot latte and read a book. They were not  able to make what i ordered, but notified me right away and the manager refunded me in cash right on the spot, and offered me whatever alternatice beverage i wanted free of charge. Excellent customer service, I was more than willing to pay for my iced coffee but the way they handled the situation really made my day. I will definitely come back, thank you!\n",
            "I went here the other day and was surprised first and foremost to see actual HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS working! I had to take a step back because in the past 10 years I can only recall seeing undocumented workers. It was a little surreal. Before anyone gets their panties in a twist, my parents are immigrants so this is not a bigoted statement. I myself and I am old enough to remember when high school students had these jobs as I had one myself! \n",
            "\n",
            "The service was actually really good. They made my sub and were fast about it and I did not have to REPEAT MYSELF. I think this is why I have not been to a fast food establishment in so long is because the service and being able to communicate your order has become non-existent! They seemed to take a lot of pride in doing their job and keeping the place clean. Not only that they had every bread available fresh!\n",

            "\n",
            "I have not eaten subway or fast food in a long time, but I would definitely be back. I have to commend the owner for hiring high school students and instilling in them some sense of work ethic. The establishment was clean (EVEN THE bathroom!) and the service was great. Someone else left a review below making a comment that this was like a mom and pop's kind of place. I have to agree with them because even though Subway is commercialized, the service environment made it feel relaxed and not rushed like many other fast food places that are cold and unfriendly.\n",
            "I will start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I have not tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n",
            "\n",
            "The atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n",
            "\n",
            "I loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n",
            "\n",
            "The owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I have had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n",
            "\n",
            "We finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, do not go on a weekend. It was awesome.\n",
            "Wow their ramen is unbelievably good. Loved their Sapporo-shio ramen. Their hand roll tuna and avocado sushi is also da bomb!\n",

            "This place is by far the best Italian food in Austin.  The location is not fabulous, so do not judge a book by its cover.  It is absolutely amazing food and the service is excellent.  The owners will come by your table and personally greet you and see how you are enjoying your meal (and believe me...you are enjoying it)!\n",

I like the chicken based soup because it is light and tasty. My kids like strong flovered soup base and the soft yolk eggs. My daughter normally do not eat eggs except this type of the flavoured egg. We packed some eggs before leaving. The customer service is fantastic and the waitress speaks Japanese and English. I will definitely go back again!\n",

            "This new location is absolutely amazing! Being able to add as many toppings as I want on the pizza is an awesome concept. I can add ass many veggies as I want and the pizza will still be the SAME price! The wood fired flavor is perfect and the pies are never burnt. The employees are always very friendly and I never feel rushed when ordering\n",

            "Note that this 5-star rating is not in comparison to the other 5-star ratings I give to some of Portland's amazing eating establishments, but rather a 5-star based on meeting and exceeding expectations.  Red Robin is a great family eating place, the kids love going here and as adults we enjoy the experience.  They give you quick service, a good selection of options and the kids walk away thrilled.  For that I give them 5-stars!  Also they just updated their menu into a nice bound (no ads like Cheesecake Factory which drives me nuts) binder of options.  \n",

Great size portions - I usually go with the hot and sour or tan tan men but the spicy miso ramen is also another go-to great. Small little joint in the Porter Square food court/Lesley University building...PRO TIP: cash only.\n",
            "Absolutely pho - bulous! It was a rainy day in Boston and a big bowl of pho was the perfect remedy. Got the #1 (of course) which comes in an extra large portion - all for $5.95. The broth and assortment of meat goodies (I love \"weird,\" chewy, textured food) were yum yum yummy. I certainly cannot think of a pho place in SF that I love more. The sliced pork rice dish looked pretty good and the spring rolls were 3-4 star quality. Pho is the way to go.\n",
            "This gorgeous location was worth the trip.  Who has not been to the Breeze?  Well, you have to visit this newer version in KISS ME because it will give you new perspective while you enjoy those hibiscus margaritas!  The wait on a busy week night (Happy Hour is until 6p) was just a few minutes and I really do not think there is a bad seat in this house.  The new space is light and airy and everyone is going to want those colorful ceiling fans in their house.  The staff is very kind - thank you, Nashlie! - and my good friend and I had a great time.  I recommend the seared Ahi tuna and the Jamaican Stuffed Plantain was enough to fill up on and satisfy my sweet tooth.  Tell you what, I drove from Apopka to this location...and I would do it again.\n",

This is my favorite spot in Somerville for dinner when friends are in town, or dinner with my sweetie. It is THE best pizza in Somerville. I also love their salads, the calamari with Peroni on tap is heaven on earth, and the carbonara is a must. Their special events are always so well thought out and often feature great wines. I love you, Posto!!!!\n",

            "I tried to find good restaurants during my trip to Portland, but ironically, the airport was the best food I had! Happy hour has some great deals, but the happy hour food is still high quality yet cheap. Reasonable $5 premium beers during HH.\n",

            "\n",
            "The food was fairly decent. The portions are not as big as some other Thai places I have been to... but they have an awesome all you can eat spring roll/salad/soup bar.

            "Our first visit to Gran Gusto was last night. I do understand from a few of the other comments that some visitors found Antonio's (the owner) friendliness a little over-the-top but we took it as being somewhat representative of what we have found in real Italian countryside restaurants...in Italy! He was welcoming, filled with information, entertaining, and very service oriented. We all enjoyed our food so much that we are returning again next Saturday night to try dishes that we saw on the menu but did not have a chance to order because there were other equally interesting dishes. We consider this place to be a \"find\"!\n",
            "It is a small restaurant but offers selection of food. All the food are always great and the quality is consistent. It is a hidden gem and I love it!\n",
            "Stopped by because we were in town for a wedding. Food was incredible and management was super nice.  We had the chicken soup, lomo, rotisserie chicken, Cuban sandwich, and veggie sandwich. Everything was delicious.\n",

            "I LOVE this bar. My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to watch the Pats game, but did not want to go into Boston. I found this place on Yelp and it was EXACTLY what we were looking for. \n",
            "\n",
            "The bar is small, homey and All-American. It reminded me of what you would see in the movies. The bar is decorated with red and blue Christmas lights and the walls are covered with police badges from all over. \n",
            "\n",
            "The Plaques: The walls are lined with plaques (and witty quotes from patrons) which my boyfriend is now on his way to obtaining his own. You ask the bartender for a card and you have to have a beer from each of the 99 breweries on their list. You can keep your card on you, or they store it for you. Max of 5 beers per visit can be crossed off. I love this idea! \n",
            "\n",
            "The bartender was SO friendly and personable, as were the other patrons. It was such a cozy and inviting atmosphere. There was quite a bit of parking along the side of the building, as well as some space up front. We will for sure be back!\n",
            "Father's Day Brunch - excellent! We had iced coffees, the Brooklyn breakfast, bagel with lox, eggs Benedict and the avocado toast and it was all fresh and delicious. So much so that we had to try the desserts so we got a banana caramel dessert and a chocolate truffle thing - we are most def driving back from West Orlando for another brunch soon. Great! Thank you!\n",

            "Cha cha cha, is outstanding. This is our second time in as many weeks. awesome food, service was slightly slow the first time, but in their defense it was the first warm evening and the patio was full. Tonights service was spot on. And the food is still  amazing.... And affordable, we even brought the teen this time. I\n",

            "They have a nice covered outdoor seating area. Exellent!\n",
            "As I write this, I am still reeling from how good the food is. I did not have dinner last night, so seeing that you get the most food for your dollar here, I thought I would try it out. Let us just say I was not disappointed.\n",
            "\n",
            "They were busy, but not overly busy when I walked in. I found a table to sit at, and my waitress eagerly gave me a menu, welcomed me, and asked what I wanted to drink. I went for an iced tea, and went about looking for what to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "When she came back with my drink, I knew what I wanted and ordered. When the food came out, I almost had a heart attack just looking at it! I did not think it would be so big! I had ordered the 'giant taco omelette'. Boy, oh boy, was it giant! I could barely finish the bad boy, let alone the two enormous pancakes it came with. I had to get a to-go box for the pancakes. I asked my waitress how many eggs were in the omelette, and she stated 10. 10!?! I almost ate a full dozen eggs?!? Yowza!\n",

            "The greens are very sweet and delicious. I got the large chicken and there was enough for two people. Its a small hole in the wall but it is definetely worth trying to locate. I would go back to atlanta to try it again.\n",

            "I came here for brunch around noon on a Sunday after hearing about the famous fries and hash browns cooked in duck fat.  The restaurant is small and connected to Edible Canada at the Market, which sells lots of specialty salts and sauces for cooking.  The atmosphere is really pleasant, with the bar and kitchen on one side and windows on the other.  We were quickly seated at a table and ordered some tea, coffee, and orange juice.  The coffee took awhile to arrive, but it is fresh french press coffee, and my fiance really enjoyed it.\n",
            "\n",
            "For food, I knew I had to have the hash browns, I could not go here and not try them.  I ordered the breakfast bun, which is actually a focaccia panini with scrambled eggs and cheese inside.  It was delicious.  It is all about the hash browns though.  They are crispy and you can definitely taste the duck fat.  It is definitely a sometimes treat.  My fiance and his sister ordered the wild mushroom benny with a side of hash browns, and her husband ordered the island breakfast.  The portions look small, but all of us were pleasantly full afterwards.  Our final bill was $68, which was a bit expensive, but it was a wonderful brunch.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would definitely come back, if only to try their grilled cheese and have more of those delicious french fries.\n",
            "Great selection of beer. Really enjoyed the ambience and a good place to relax after a long day. Great staff at the bar who know how to strike conversations.\n",
            "The wine selection is great, the owners and employees are always are very nice and the atmosphere is lovely. You see a lot of regulars there for good reason. (I have not been here other than during the evening for drinks, however, so I can only comment on that aspect.) Bottom line, it is a great place to go if you are looking for a mellow evening. Plus supporting local businesses is always a plus. Will definitely come back.\n",
            "I LOVE FRIES!!! So saus is just the perfect place for me. I love this concept with all the different sauces, I had the poutine with truffled mushrooms - to die for!\n",
            "The dolmas are delicious!  I will be back for more! They had just closed, but happily took my order!   This is authentic yummy Greek food with excellent pricing!\n",
            "I was very impressed by The Bean! The coffee was great, the co-owner was friendly, and it is a nice space to sit, relax, and drink your coffee. I had one of their blueberry chocolate muffins, which was gigantic and delicious - perfect size for splitting with a friend. I also liked that they kept the creamer, milk, etc. in a little fridge instead of leaving it on the counter in a pitcher like other coffee shops tend to do. I will definitely be returning.\n",

            "My daughter is getting a little old for this now, but up to age four its a pretty great spot. Brightly designed, clean and spacious - there are enough spots about for parents to sit and watch their children while they play.\n",
            "\n",
            "The coffee is great here. The snacks are even better. Usual play place snacks consist of orange Cheetos, pizza and vegetable sticks with a side of despair... This place serves \"tapas\" !!! Children can enjoy a mix plate of crackers, cheese or ham, fruit and veggies. Their baked goods are yummy too and they do not seem to mind if you just want to relax and read for an hour and a bit while your kid makes new friends.\n",
            "\n",
            "The people who run it are super friendly too. They have a system that is pretty neat to identify children and parents. You have to sign up the first time but it makes future visits a lot faster and easier.\n",

            "I like how they had a \"nice spoons\" (clean) and \"naughty spoons\" (dirty) area last time we arrived too. Got to love a good sense of humour.\n",
            "This review is for our private room dining experience. We ran pretty late getting there due to traffic and heavy rain fall. Our waitor, Rodrigo was super attentive and courteous to my whole party from the very beginning to the end. The food came out in a timely manner. It was so yummy and the portions were the perfect amount as family style. We were all so stuffed!! I loved that they printed out The menu for our table with the event title on there, such a cute touch. The only issue we had were very minor but I feel worth mentioning. Our icecream was pretty soft and melted fast when we got it. The guests who had some were left with a quick icecream puddle on their plate. Also, for 8-10 people we only got two hearty slices of cheesecake compared to the ample amount of brownie bites. But by this time our clothes were pushing their limits anyways. Our service was amazing, thank you again Rodrigo. We will definitely be back again.\n",
            "Such a great place to hang out with your friends or even go on a date! Best. Tapas. I have. Ever. Tasted. Especially love the chorizo and fig! Me and my friends devoured every last bit before being able to take pics of it lol.\n",
            "\n",
            "Downside of the place: hard to make conversations because the music was too loud, and apparently they are super popular. So... Make RSVP. Would definitely come back again\n",
            "Wow... this place was the highlight of my culinary adventures in Austin. I would describe the food as new American with definite Southwest nods.  And due to kind neighbors sitting at the bar, we got to try dishes we did not even order.  Let us start with a hats off to the Carrot Cake French toast.  Wow was this good.  Definitely something to share... it was waaayy to rich for me to want to eat alone.  This is really dessert... disguised in the form of a brunch dish.  Literally pieces of carrot cake griddled and topped with a nutty cream cheese spread.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also tried the salsa trio sampler and chips.  All of the 'award winning' salsas were bright with tomato-y acidity and really, really good.  \n",
            "\n",
            "After all that heavy goodness, I managed to sample a special Barracuda fish salad that was yummy - the fish was perfectly grilled and topped the crisp greens nicely.  Also dipped into my dining companion's creamy, thick and slightly sweet butternut squash soup.\n",

            "I will definitely be back to this place the next time I am in town.\n",
            "Fancy schmancy donuts! My favorite was the Grand Marnier and the Passion Fruit cocoa nib. Spectacular! I wish I lived at least on the same side of the country, but alas, I do not! I had these amazing donuts a year ago, and I am still seeking a comparable donut in the DC area... Alas!\n",

            "I absolutely loved this place! The food and specialty drinks were delicious.  We ordered about 15-18 dishes and none of them disappointed.  MUST GET THE EMPANADAS!  Our waiter was fantastic and knowledgeable about the food and knew how to course it out for us.  The Manager was friendly and seemed to have gone over to every table to see how everything was going.\n",

            "Stopped here on our way out to the coast when we realized we had not eaten all day. First time in, the staff was super helpful and explained everything. The pizza was fresh and the toppings too! The food came out fast and they even had $2 beer in Tuesday's! This place was great\n",
            "Unbelievably good. And the decor reminded me of my childhood in Wiesbaden. We were seated under a few awesome cookoo clocks next to a piano and some paintings of old houses in the mountains. Ah nostalgia. \n",
            "The food is amazingly filling and about as authentic as you can get from the wide variety of sausages and kraut down to the black forest cake.\n",
            "Would I eat here again? Oh you betcha.\n",
            "The beer list is also nothing to scoff at. They have quite a selection of german beers and schnapps. \n",
            "Now I want a beer...\n",

            "Best fried chicken anywhere, hands down, no contest.  Had it for the first time years ago in Memphis, and this location is serving up the same great spicy crispy delicious goodness a decade later in a new city. That Other Austin Chicken place makes very good chicken, but this chicken goes to 11.\n",
            "\n",
            "Good beer selection, heavy on the locals, a TV if you like, minus 1-star for merely passable sides, but plus 1-star because after all, chicken is the star of the show and it wins.\n",

            "\n",
            "The service was friendly and attentive without being bothersome.  The restaurant itself has nice clean lines, modern decor and well lit...could not take any more of the hackneyed shabby chic of South Austin....\n",
            "\n",
            "We were just driving by and decided it was time for lunch.  I had seen the place previously and it looked inviting enough that I thought someday I would get around to trying it.  Puled into the parking lot and my first thought was \"OMG...we found a parking spot...something must be wrong with this place.\"  Being a bit paranoid, because I have had one too many disappointing overhyped food experiences in Austin, I quickly viewed Yelp on my phone...only to be a bit shocked with the low scores.  Something like 3.5 stars...Hell every dump in Austin usually gets at least 4....It is Mexican food...how astray can you go in Austin???  Then I remembered that Austin is the home of hipsters and food trucks...yes...anything over $9 usually gets panned.  Austin is not really about good food...but about cheap food.  So when I discovered that this place charges about $3 more per plate than nearby Polvos, then I figured it probably is not the food that is bad but rather a typical Austin reaction to \"higher than food truck\" pricing.\n",
            "\n",
            "In any event, we went in.  The first thing I noticed is that the restaurant was filled with mostly middle aged, mature types...not many twenty ( or even thirty) something is here.  That is was a good sign in my book.\n",
            "\n",
            "I ordered the enchiladas de camarones and my wife had the enchiladas with mole.  Both were very good  Nice balanced flavors.  Not spicy ( to which I am partial) but still very tasty.  I would certainly recommend this place to someone who is looking for something a bit different than the usual Tex-Mex fare. It was more a bit nouveau Mexican and nice for a change.\n",
            "Moving from NYC area to Orlando finding good chinese is as difficult as finding a good bagel in Florida! Once again I was told that their food was just like NYC chinese...again? Reluctantly we went to give them a try...and guess what? It was delicious and just like being in NYC Chinatown! servers were very friendly, food was brought out quickly and it is worth repeating that the food was delicious. It is worth a trip and You have got to try the pork fried rice, it is that good!\n",
            "First of all the beautiful woman running the place was so generous and kind! She really took care of us.  Based upon reviews we selected the Embilta Special.  Everything was delicious.  We primarily eat vegetarian and so Ethiopian cuisine is perfect!\n",
            "This is your typical sports bar! It is fantastic for hockey fans, golf fans, football fans, you name it! It is the type of place you go with your friends for a beer and some apps. I have only been once but it was a fun experience. Our waiter was impeccable and always on top of things. I wish I remembered his name! We had deviled eggs which as simple as they are we are just to die for. We also had cheese curds which were pretty good! I had a burger with Gouda cheese and it was lovely! I enjoyed everything I had there and the atmosphere was great. It is not a place to take family or on a first date but it is definitely a fun place to unwind and have a beer after a long day of Universal adventures!\n",
            "Mr. Le's is THE best food on earth! When I lived in MA, my husband and I used to come here at least once a week, and when we moved to Vermont, we would travel 4 hours about once a month to eat here, and now that we live in Florida, when we travel up to New England, we make a point to travel to eat here. My husband loves the Lemongrass Tofu, and I love the Tofu Curry. It has the perfect combination of sweet and savory tastes, and is loaded with fresh veggies. The crispy spring rolls, fresh spring rolls and the rolls that you roll yourself are all splendid. The soup is also really great, but really, the curry is to die for! I have eaten at 15-20 different Viet restaurants across the country, and I always leave wishing that I could send them to the chef at Le's for a lesson.\n",
            "Do not hesitate, try this place if you are in the area. You will not regret it!\n",
            "Had the chicken kabob in pita, Really good.  Plenty of juicy grilled hot chicken, cold crispy lettuce, cool cucumber and tomato, plus good yogurt sauce.  A great balance of hot and cold, veggie and meat, crisp and juicy.  In a word - satisfying.\n",
            "Excellent, and recommended! The owners are very nice, and seem genuinely interested in delivering a good dining experience. I had the chilli chicken, khadai paneer and andhra chicken curry, based on the owners recommendation and these did not disappoint. I thought they could have done a better job with their garlic naans, but in light of the other food, I am going to let it go. Nice ambiance as well and its refreshing to not walk out of a restaurant and smell like an Indian kitchen (Chennai masala!)\n",
            "Been here twice, this time for brunch. \n",
            "\n",
            "The space is pretty small so I would imagine it gets packed for early brunch but we showed up at 12 and there were not many customers there. The interior is pretty neat, hardwood floors and tables and more initmate space makes it feel a bit cozier\n",
            "\n",
            "The fried chicken Benedict is a wonderful combination of biscuits and gravy and fried chicken. The breading on the chicken was top notch and very crunchy while being complimented by the soft and sweet Benedict on top. So many carbs, but well worth it\n",
            "Fantastic Chinese food! I was visiting from NYC and I wish we had Chinese food like this! Their dumplings were great but their cooked food was fantastic. We got the clams, pork and crab soup dumplings, lotus root, thousand year egg with tofu, jellyfish, fish dumplings, and Chinese broccoli. Every single item was delicious and authentic. Will definitely be dreaming about this restaurant when I am back on the East Coast.\n",
            "I am from New York City and after moving down here a few years ago I have resigned to myself that Florida does not have any decent pizza.  Then I found 'A Touch of Basil'.  The place is unassuming and space is not much in terms of room but that is not why I came here.  It was all about the pizza.  I was not expecting much but gave it a try.  I am so glad I did.  Finally!!!!! Real New York style pizza that I can say that is actually delicious.  Perfect crust, tasty sauce with the right amount of cheese.  The part that make me smile the most was seeing the \"grease\".  If your from New York you know exactly what I am talking about.  That sent me over the top.  They sell by the slice or the various different sizes of your choice.  Be warned.  The XXL pizzas are HUGE.  I gave it 5 stars.  I wish I could give this place a extra star for being authentic.  Thank you 'A Touch of Basil' for making me feel like I was back home.  I definitely will be returning again and again.\n",

            "\n",
            "I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, I have had it many places before and while it was not the best I have ever had it was very tasty, lots of saffron. The rice was cooked perfect and while that may seem like a small detail to some it is a big turn off for me. The naan bread tasted delicious dipped into the sauce. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our server suggested the fried wontons for dessert which were also very tasty. The pineapple in between the wontons was still very juicy and paired wonderfully with the sauce.\n",

            "\n",
            "Our service was wonderful, even though they were pretty busy our server Carley had a wonderful and welcoming attitude. She gave great suggestions on food and was always there when we needed anything. We had one little issues were our food had started to be cleared away while we were in the restroom but Carley and the manager were very apologetic and brought my daughter another full meal. \n",
            "\n",
            "This restaurant is a nice little get away in the middle of the park that you can calm down the day, eat some tasty food and enjoy the friendly service. We will definitely be dining here again.\n",
            "Our server (Jeff) was the best I may have ever experienced.  He knew his food, clearly loved his job, and knows how to pass patron's desires to the kitchen so that they get exactly what they want and in the way wanted.  Food was outstanding as well!\n",
            "I love this place! Enough said. The service is great. The place is small, quaint, and cozy. The food is always on point and spectacular. The wine list is great. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Make sure you make a reservation because tables fill up quickly!\n",

            "Overall Recommendation:  If you like fried chicken, you should definitely check this place out.  Be forewarned that it is not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\n",

The boys manning the Sub station are busy, so it helps if you know what you want when you walk in there. D'Angelo's Who? At Bob's they give you the shaved Rib Eye - the real deal with no little balls of gristle that you get in most pizza joints! There are 4 sizes with the large tagged at only 7 bucks and the jumbo at 7.50! In your face D'Angelo's! Let the grease drip down my chin and onto my shirt with this big fat savory sangueech! \n",

            "\n",
            "The food is great, with creative rolls and dishes but they have all the traditional stuff as well like nigiri and sashimi.  The service is excellent too.  Also, the place is owned by locals.  It means your money stays local and does not go to some corporate office in another state.  \n",

            "I came here with my dad and boyfriend the night before the Hot Chocolate 15k so that we could get all our carbs for the race. We ordered the small mixed greens salad, a small mozzarella garlic bread, a small baked ziti (Which I got for free because I got a coupon with becoming a Buca Di Beppo member or whatever you want to call it), and a small cavatappi with meatballs. The salad was so good and I loved the dressing. The garlic bread was honestly one of my favorite parts because the cheese was so thick and delicious, it was hard for me to stop eating it. The pastas were a giant hit too and the meatballs were great. They are huge for sure, but we each got our own anyways. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so much fun and it is like you are in someone is giant, crazy home. There are funny pictures all over the walls that you can look at and stay entertained for the whole meal. I love Buca and it is a great place to go with a giant group, or maybe just 2 others if you can all eat a ton and have a race the next morning.\n",

You fill out a sheet saying how many you want of which taco and they come out family style. We ordered the spread which consisted of pork, redfish, shrimp, Baja, portobello, chorizo, and I cannot even remember the others but they were delicious. I was also told by members of my family that the margaritas were delicious. The vibe was super chill and had a rustic feel to it with the woodwork and decor. I highly recommend giving it a try!\n",
            "Great service. Incredible food. Try the ribeye, and (my favorite) Lobster Mac and Cheese! For dessert, the Creme Brûlée is out of this world.\n",
            "This is the BEST place to get Szechuan green beans. They are crisp n tender, never pruney and wrinkled doused in excess oil like other standard chinese/mandarin places do. Fried Rice, wontons and dumplings, various beef and pork dishes are sooo tasty!  \n",

            "Great restaurant! We had breakfast around 9:30 on Friday and parking was easy. We were greeted and sat immediately. Staff is very attentive and nice. Husband had chicken with pancakes. Waitress suggested he mix the pepper jam with the maple syrup and use it as a dip. It was phenomenal. I had poached eggs on Parmesan asparagus. So good! Coffee was stellar. Husband had 4 cups. \n",

It is, however, always so busy in there, regardless of when you get there. The sauce, the bread, the veal...so good you just have to try it. Just get there early to get a seat and you will not be disappointed.\n",

The sushi is always excellent - fresh and well prepared, and the variety is a welcome diversion from the standard sushi fare.  The service is great and the chefs are friendly.  Be prepared for a relatively expensive meal, but it is still worth it.\n",

We have been back twice since and everything we have tried has been amazing. The prices are good, and the selection is great. Its always packed out every time we have been, but we have never had to wait more than 10-15 min for a table. All in all I cannot wait to go again. I am getting hungry just writing this review. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.\n",
            "Made reservations here for my boyfriend's birthday. We were seated within 2 minutes of our arrival time which was about 10 minutes before our reservation time. When I filled out the reservation I advised that we were celebrating a birthday and our table had little glittery balloon shaped  confetti when we were seated. I had a cocktail which tasted good, and the bartender was generous with the Vodka. We ordered lobster bisque, which was bursting with flavor and had ample lobster in it. Appetizers were calamari and a shrimp dish that I do not remember. Both were excellent. There was a variety of bread that was brought to the table. We both had steaks (Boyfriend had large Porterhouse with a Kona rub and I had medallion filets with a Kona rub and lobster tails) --his was perfectly cooked at medium all the way through but my steak was slightly under medium and made my plate a little red. Usually when steaks are under medium I do not enjoy them but this one was amazing and the flavor was spectacular, so I did not mind as much. Sides were mashed potatoes and lobster mac & cheese. The Mac and cheese may not have been for me as I did not enjoy it as much as everyone else in the reviews, however the mashed potatoes were delicious. After dinner, they brought my boyfriend a piece of cheesecake and a flourless espresso cake on the house, that he said was pretty good! It was a lovely night and the service was just as impressive as the food. The price ($$!) is well worth it. Easily the best restaurant I have been to in Atlanta. Would go again for a very special occasion.\n",

The presentation was so pretty and so thoughtfully done that it made very easy to transfer onto my own serving dishes. Noom is the cutest delivery guy in the whole world!! They made an early morning delivery and an afternoon delivery so that everything would be fresh and lovely. Teem (I think that is how her name is spelled) is the owner I believe, was lovely to work with. She made great suggestions, called me back several times before my big day to check on the status of things, and worked with my budget!!\n",

            "I live about 30 minutes away from here but try to go at least once a month. Hands down the best German food I have had outside of Germany (and better then even some places in Germany). The atmosphere feels a bit like an old pancake cafe in a strip mall, but do not let that get you down. Its on the maid drag of downtown Sanford, a cute little area with some great local art galleries. The live music is always fun and the place is packed by 6pm Friday and Saturday (I have been told no reservations are taken the two times I tried to make them). The pretzel is amazing, schnitzel is awesome, you cannot go wrong! Food prices are a bit up there, but worth it! Also awesome dessert! Service has always been great as well.\n",

You truly cannot ask for more for a luxurious night out.\n",

We placed our order in the front register and payed. We waited a few minutes while they cleaned a few tables that were dirty. 10-15 minutes later they called our food number. I had two tacos de tripa and a sope de pollo. The sope was okay but the tacos were awesome. I had to go back and order another 3 tacos. ( I ordered the tripa bien dorada) Also, the agua de horchata was very good. I am usually very picky when it comes to horchata. \n",

For $7.50, the 2 egg breakfast came with: 2 eggs, choice of toast, choice of meat, and a choice of either red skin potatoes or a serving of fruit. The $13.50 chicken and waffle entree had a large amount of chicken which is great. The waffle was 1 big piece of waffle that was cut nearly into 4 pieces. The meal was delicious, the bacon was flavored extremely well and the red skin potatoes tasted extremely healthy. The flavor on the chicken was superb as well. The service was exceptional and we will definitely be back\n",

You can taste the lemon in the Lemonberry pancakes which were light and fluffy and chock full of blueberries. The Thai chicken wrap is a hefty portion stuffed with veggies and chicken. Sweet potato fries were crispy and just enough sweetness. Mahi Burger & potato salad well I looked over at my dad's plate and it was wiped clean I am going to assume it was good. I ordered the huevos Rancheros and honestly it was the least favorite of everything. The tortillas were too hard and difficult to cut, the flavors were semi there but I would not order it again. \n",

            "All of their dishes are pretty authentic and they definitely have a few Thai staples. I always start out with some Tom Yum soup or Spring Rolls, and after that I usually wish I had gotten the firepot of Tom Yum for even more goodness. The Papaya salad is another one of my favorites, as is the Pad Kee Mao, which can get pretty spicy if you want it to. Is it bad that I love it when the food is so spicy that I am practically crying? They are happy tears. I promise. The basil, mushroom, and Thai chili flavor of the Pad Kee Mao is delicious. All of their dishes just have so much flavor and I have never complained about any of them. The Pad Thai is always a good option in general as well.\n",

There are a several rounds: deuces and four tops, but there is one lovely and enormous farm table that is communal and has many seats. There are also leather lounge chairs, which look great for sipping and reading. We would never have found this place (in the area for an event) except for the fact that one cafe, which is not a juice bar, paid for a bump and appeared under the listing for \"juice bars\". They literally have no juice, but the woman at the counter was extremely sweet. Anyhow, she did not tell us about this place--on the same street--but, once we were already in the neighborhood, Yelp showed us this place, which is, a juice bar.\n",

The menu is not huge, but with several tempting options. We had the prime rib and the risotto on our first visit and then the smoked fried chicken and grilled cauliflower on our second. Everything we have ordered has been just outstanding. And, to top it off, the service is both professional and friendly.

We were slightly skeptical since we walked in and were immediately seated at the bar, but we ultimately had no reason to worry. The bartender was very friendly and service was excellent. The food was incredible. I had the gnocchi di ricotta and my sister had the orecchiette al pesto, both of which were amazing and reasonably priced for the area and quality of food. The marti gras theme was a little quirky, but was a nice fun conversation piece. Would definitely return.\n",

India Flavors did not disappoint.  completely remodeled, the only thing in common with its predecessor is the physical address.  We enjoyed Dosas, Andhra Chicken Curry ( perfect flavor spice combo), Chicken Biryiani.  We probably took as much home as we ate.  The presentation is lovely, the servers were very attentive and knowledgable about all the dishes.  Having spent some time in India, and having fallen in love with the food, i can say this is as authentic as it gets.  It will not take long before the local Indian population finds and loves this place like i do.\n",
            "Had lunch there twice in two weeks. The food and service were great. The dizzy pig burger, walnut salad and flatbreads were wonderful! Prices are very reasonable with most items under $10. They have outdoor and indoor seating. I suggest Indoor if you want to talk, as it is a bit quieter. They have all kinds of games to take to your table to play. My friend and I played Connect 4 to pass the time while waiting for our lunch. Someday I will go ahead and order the S'mores Cannot wait to see what $7.50 S'mores taste like. Definitely recommend going there!\n",

My meticulously packaged order came with two sauces, one spicy and the other mild and more tangy - a generous amount to go with the eight momos. The meat is moist and juicy, and the outer wrap soft but not sticky, they were both of the perfect texture! If you think one order is small, you are sorely wrong! I was absolutely stuffed after slowly finishing off my plate. I will probably be a regular going forward, I must have some of that naan and biryani!\n",

Thankfully that was the only let down for these Bay Area business owners that year. The owners have created equal parts dive bar and saloon with enough Portlandness to keep you coming back. If the owners spent half as much time caring about their fantasy football teams as they do running this joint they probably would not fail season after season. Then again, probably not. Order the drumsticks and a cold Montucky. You will not be sorry.\n",

This is a welcome addition to the restaurants in Austin as there is not an overabundance of Cajun cooking to be found. they did again OMG the Belgian chocolate cheese cake with Carmel sauce is YUMMY. Check out this or the Strawberries and Cheesecake absolutely delicious. Love the wait staff too they are so kind and attentive.\n",
            "Spent the day in Vancouver to get ready for a cruise to Alaska.  Everyone says that Vancouver has awesome Chinese food.  As a native San Franciscan, I was a bit skeptical.  Wow!  This place was really awesome!  I am not a fan of pan fried pork dumpling as usually it is too doughy for my taste or just dry.  This place was fluffy, crispy and soupy!  How is that possible?!  The Shanghai dumpling was also so soupy you could see the soup sagging at the bottom of the dumpling!  Yah, the service was not exemplary, but they were okay once you got their attention.  You definitely need to stop by here and checking it out!\n",
            "Obsessing over both rib options. I am a huge fan of Thai food and they definitely do not disappoint\n",
            "This probably one of best burger places ever or at least in Texas. Look for something different try out hopdoddy burger.\n",
            "We went there when it was slow, our pizzas were quickly prepared and the staff was friendly. We did not try the deserts or salads, though the desert pizzas looked delicious so that will probably happen next time we come here. The sauce and crust were not anything special, but my own topping combination was wonderful and I liked being able to have ALL the veggies I like (I picked 6). Additionally, the staff let my girlfriend do something slightly off - menu by using their pesto drizzle  as the sauce instead of as a topping: she was super happy and I appreciated the flexibility. That further reinforced the need for 5 stars.\n",
            "\n",
            "We will be back for sure! For the price, this is a pretty darn good deal with unlimited topping possibilities.\n",
            "After much time and a failed attempt, I finally got to Speed's!\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a great dog. I want some like it at home (go ahead, call the waaahmbulance for me). \n",
            "\n",
            "I got one loaded. It was quite good. The BF eats his dogs plain --yeah I know. I did discover that I really really really like mustard on my dogs. \n",
            "\n",
            "I was so very thankful that the bun could hold up to the dog. Sometimes the bread just cannot handle it and you end up a super mess. I had been forewarned (thanks!) and even brought wet naps to clean up with.\n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot wait for next time so I can get one with yellow mustard!\n",
            "\n",
            "BY THE WAY it really is an easy walk from Andrew Station. Hard to find my patoot.\n",
            "I love this place! I always get take-out here. It is so delicious and affordable. The Pad Thai does not disappoint- It tastes so fresh and is consistently good. The portions are also large enough to have leftovers. The staff is also very friendly!\n",
            "This is a place for really cheap and good food for luch!\n",
            "They do have Tofu Vietnamese Sandwich which is Vegan.\n",
            "(I am pretty sure that bread is Vegan, but I do not know)\n",
            "They also have Bento Box to go for Vegetarians.\n",
            "They have Fake Chicken with rice.\n",
            "(which usually they have egg white, so this is not Vegan)\n",
            "This place is sooooo good that I really like it!\n",
            "You can get Bubble tea and Sandwich for less than $10!\n",
            "It is much much cheaper than paying $18 for junky lunch around Summer/Congress Street.\n",
            "Outstanding tacos! This is the closest Mexican food to San Diego/Baja Mexican, that I have found in Portland since moving up here in February. \n",
            "\n",
            "Their Carne Asada, Carnitias, Al Pastor, Chorizo, and Chicken tacos is a must! Plus, having free guacamole in their salsa bar is unheard of (at least in the US). \n",
            "\n",
            "The only con is that they increased their prices from $1 to $1.25/taco and being cash only. However, it is still worth it. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Keep in mind that their hours are different than what is stated on Yelp. Not sure if it is a summer thing, but they are only open during lunch time (noon) on Mondays and Sundays. Very disappointing......\n",
            "Why did not I write the review for this yet? \n",
            "\n",
            "Whenever I fly east, I am trying to switch planes in Atlanta to have a oh so delicious chicken sandwich with riffled fries and lots of mayo.\n",
            "\n",
            "Only once has this Chick-fil-A been closed - due to a national holiday (or was it a Sunday? cannot remember) which brought a tear to my eye. But every other time I have not been let down.\n",
            "\n",
            "Already looking forward to December 2010 which will mark two more occasions. Yay!\n",
            "Seaworld was the best experience of our holiday - we went twice! When we went Shamu was having her baby and so we went back and were able to see the baby whale. I got to touch a dolphin - what a really amazing thing. I would go back again when we visit Orlando again. Not to be missed.\n",
            "Best Chinese food I had since I have been here in Orlando. Now the service was outstanding and that is putting it mildly. Our waiter was an older gentleman but he was fast friendly and anticipated all our needs he even got us warm washcloths to wipe our faces to make us feel better. I have never had kind of personalized service from a Chinese restaurant ever and I am a Chinese person too!!  Kudos to the staff and the chef there keep up the great food and fantastic service\n",
            "Favorite Vietnamese spot I have had so far after living in Austin the last 3 years. Highly recommend the tofu bahn mi, spring rolls & pho. Other perks: quick service, very casual environment, lots of parking.\n",
            "Love...... It is a little pricy comparatively speaking but great quality! My husband and I have eaten pho all over the place even at his parents house ( who are S.E. Asians ) and we all love the broth here! Best pho in Oregon by far!!\n",
            "I am still new to Georgia and the Atlanta area and really miss my old go to Italian restaurant in Charlotte that had been around for ages (The Italian Kitchen in case you are ever in the area). Today was our second time here. I have passed it so many time on the way home from work and after looking it up and seeing it had been around for quite some time we gave it a try on my birthday early in September. \n",
            "\n",
            "Today was our second time there and I still loved it just as much as the first time we went. We have had the \"mad mozz bread\" both times and it is\n",
            "My husband and I dine here regularly and every dish is fantastic. My favorites are the Smoked Mushroom Ravioli and Rigatoni a la Vodka (with sausage). Get the half portion--it is perfect with a salad.\n",
            "\n",
            "My husband always orders an Arnold Palmer. The fresh iced tea with freshly muddled lemons is a perfect blend of refreshing goodness hand-crafted and shaken tableside by one of the excellent staff.\n",
            "\n",
            "Service is excellent. They do not take reservations so there can be a wait, but it is well worth it.\n",
            "This is my favorite restaurant in Boulder.  Great covered outdoor seating or classy indoor seating.  The highlight is their tapas menu with amazing dates, fresh bruschetta, and bacon-wrapped shrimp.  Consistent food quality and service in a neighborly location.\n",
            "My husband works near this restaurant and goes there frequently for lunch. FINALLY he took the family for dinner!  Wow have we been missing out!  The food was excellent; the service was excellent; the prices are very reasonable and servings were very generous.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We had pot stickers as an appetizer (they were the biggest I have ever had - very good); then shared sweet & sour chicken, sesame beef and another chicken dish I cannot remember the name of.  I could see the waiters/waitresses in the corner carefully watching tables in case someone was looking to have dishes cleared, more tea brought, etc.  They were very attentive without being in your face.\n",
            "\n",
            "The name of the restaurant is a little odd and the location - it is just tucked into a strip mall near Vancouver Mall.  Do not let that deter you - this is a great place for Chinese food.  We will not be driving to Portland for P.F. Chang's any longer - no need; this is so much closer and every bit as good.\n",
            "This place is so much like where we ate in China daily, it is scary. As the previous review said, hole in the wall describes it well. It is certainly very close to authentic! \n",
            "\n",
            "Now from what I can tell the simple menu lends itself to the authenticity. Is this the food I would go into a fancy restaurant and eat in China? Not really. This is the food of the people. The average man. This is what you would find wedged into a free spot at a subway station.  Or  even being cooked outside.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had the beef noodle soup. When my wife found out they were not Guilin Noodles she elected to have another noodle dish. Best noodle soup I have had since China, I AM GOING TO. I think she would have liked it. On the other hand what she had (some kind of noodles served on a plate with a brownish sauce over them) elicited high praise and she even said it tasted the the way her brother made it. We split  the BBQ lamb skewers (8 on a plate) which  tasted exactly like the street BBQ in my wife's hometown. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our meal today was about $21 after tax. In China, it probably would have been somewhere around $5-6. Seven skewers of street BBQ in China would be around 8 RMB or a little more than a $1. Not complaining at all, I just find it interesting to compare. \n",
            "\n",
            "So for a taste of China, I would encourage a trip to Chen's! We will be back for the shaved noodles!\n",
            "What this place lacks in ambiance it makes up for in quality and service.  I will never visit Vancouver without a stop at Best Quality Sweets for take out gulab jamun and samoas.  Super nice people.\n",
            "This is such a cute little cafe! I have driven by this place many times and had not noticed it until today. Glad I stopped-the famous chicken waffle was delish!\n",
            "The pizza is fantastic! The service is great and the place has a nice casual atmosphere. Perfect place for a relaxing beer and bite to eat.\n",
            "This place is very close to my home, so we get takeout.  We tried it because they left a flyer on our door and I had not had Asian food delivery for years.  I love the stuff.  We were just hoping for \"not disappointing\".  We were blown away at the quality, freshness, and flavors.  The food does not have \"that Chinese restaurant taste\" that seems like they all use the same source for sauces etc.  It is not gloppy, salty, greasy - the veggies are firm and slightly crunchy.  There are some things you just do not order at some restaurants - like seafood, steak or unfamiliar things - I do not order anything but breakfast at IHOP.  At this place I am confident to order anything that interests my palate.  Whether I love what new thing I have ordered or not, I know it is been prepared very well.  It still tastes quite good.  Quite a feat. \n",
            "\n",
            "We have not sat in to eat, but I have been there often enough to comment.  They have been doing some decor renovations, the place is doing very well.  The dining area is not large, but it is open with enough room to easily be comfortable.  Not  jammed with tables.  It is a nice eating scene, with plenty of parking, that is not hectic or loud, even when busy.  \n",
            "\n",
            "As far service, I am very pleased.  On the phone taking orders and at the counter they are both polite and pleasant, greeting with smiles.  I always feel like a valued customer.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I am biased because they are around the corner and I want them to have continued success.  I am taking my sister there for her first time tomorrow.  She is a picky eater who loves Asian food and cannot stand noise.  I will update then.\n",
            "Octane has the best coffee in the city. Hands down!! Just the yummy jolt I need to get my day flowing.\n",
            "Great brunch. If large group then tables/ group  are split up since they only have 4 top  tables and smaller booths . Food is excellent\n",
            "I recently visited the new Green Mesquite BBQ in South Park Meadows. I was very impressed. The food lives up to the great reputation and the staff is super friendly. I had the chopped beef sandwich and potato salad and my little brother had the smoked chicken wings. It was delicious and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for great Texas BBQ. I have been back and I will travel across town for what I believe to be Austin's best barbecue. Also the restaurant is very clean!!!\n",
            "Perhaps the greatest thing to happen to waffles since Eggos. I have only had the dessert waffles, not the savory. Every time I am in Portland I stop by here at least once. The nutella and bananas waffle is delicious. The blueberry one is amazing as well. They have specials that last for a limited time that can also be good, but I like sticking to the regular menu.  There is no other place like this so if you are in Portland I would recommend you go.\n",
            "Sometimes in life you stumble across a food or dessert that makes you smile upon first bite. The Waffle Window's dessert waffles are that ambrosia of a dessert. I ate (nearly the entirety) of the Blueberry Cheesecake & Nutella with Sliced Bananas variations. I love their Liege style with the crunchy little pearl sugar bits too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Two elements I really liked about the cheesecake waffle were the the graham cracker crumblies (not powder-fine, yet not cut the roof of your mouth either), and the cheesecake flavored pudding that was not-too-thick, not-too-runny so it rested atop the waffle rather than soaking in and rendering the waffle mushy. \n",
            "\n",
            "The nuance that I appreciated from the Nutella waffle was that the fine dusting of cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar to finish it all off. Cinnamon with bananas, hazelnut and cocoa play quite nicely together!\n",
            "\n",
            "Will be going back. Will probably be ordering two dessert waffles just like last time.\n",
            "Love this place! Especially during happy hour. We had brisket chilli, pulled pork sandwich, fried green tomatoes, and brisket sandwich.  The drinks are strong and they even have some whiskey tastings on some days! Love the brick and wood theme which continues to the bathrooms. A lovely place to get your southern food on!\n",
            "Excited to have this great coffee option so close by. Got my standard soy latte, and it was really great and well made! I could tell that the barista working was not only passionate about his coffee, but also seemed determined to make sure customers were stoked on their drinks! I will be coming back.\n",
            "This place is amazing. Best Turkish food in town, hands down. Our server, Sam was engaging, knowledgeable, and efficient! We ordered so much food because everything was so delicious. I would recommend the lamb sauté. It was sooo delicious. We will be back here for sure!\n",
            "Do not change a thing Bob's... your Italian subs, and cheesesteaks are to die for... i dream about your antipasto calamari and stuffed peppers... the homemade pastas and ravioli (prosciutto & caramelized onion; lobster; goat cheese, etc.) are affordable and beyond delicious... the pasta station ! the meats ! forget about it!\n",
            "In a city (world?) awash in fake Irish bars, this shoebox of a pub stands above the rest. If Yorkshire Pudding is something you remember your Nan providing for those Sunday dinners of your childhood, head straight there now! Live music Sunday evenings I am witnessing now, fiddles and acoustics for shanties and jigs, this place is the real deal.\n",
            "Everything at this place is great, it does not matter if you are getting breakfast or lunch! They have lots of gf options, including gf waffles! The servers are friendly and the space is shabby chic and clean!\n",
            "What a find!  Somewhat obscure location (for Boulder that means neither on Pearl Street pedestrian mall nor adjacent to campus), but amazing food.  Had carnitas tacos that were the best I have ever tasted.  Pleasant outdoor dining area is a real plus.\n",
            "You absolutely can not go to Vancouver without stopping into this cafe.  Do tries:  paella, cassoulet, waffle w/ dark chocolate and any latte is a delicious latte...most especially the lavender latte.  Come early if you do not want to wait.  Seating is tight so if you do not like sitting close to your fellow diners, go elsewhere.  This place is worth the coziness and worth the wait.\n",
            "Had an excellent experience at TD today. It looks like they have replaced some folks or at least the former crew was not here today. I have been here many times before but never experienced the level of feeling welcomed. The staff were friendly, communicative and ALL seemed to have a smile and a positive attitude. For me it is important to have positive people preparing my food. On top of that, the food even looked better, fresher and tasted delicious!!!\n",
            "Face it, there are not many greek/mediterranean options in the city.  There is not a Greektown in Atlanta like some other cities and definitely not a Greektown Casino like Detroit (though i wish there were).  But i do not think you can beat this place for bang for the buck quick mediterranean food.  This is a staple in my diet when i need a quick falafel or qyro fix.  And with two locations equi-distant from me, i am going to stay a regular.\n",
            "I have been coming to this Cactus Club location often. I have never been disappointed. Food is great. The hostesses and servers are great. This one time I came in with a friend, our hostess was a little busy and it took a while for us to get our water. My friend waved down someone we thought was a server but he actually turned out to be the manager. He politely said I will get your food order as soon as possible and make sure you get your water. He was awesome! He got our food expedited (got it within 10 minutes) and he brought our water right away. He even gave us a complementary dessert (it was so delicious). We were not complaining but just wondering why it was taking so long to get our water because I had limited time to eat lunch. The manager really stepped up and the food was awesome as usual. My salad and chicken quesadilla were delicious. We thanked and shook hands with the manager who really made a big difference with our customer experience.\n",
            "Awesome place for tapas and superb service.  A must place to dine.\n",
            "Jackpot ! Came to downtown before my flight out. Needed a good coffee some place with wifi to get some work done. Easy parking, nice and clean, two story with modern design and friendly staff and gooooodd coffee.. \n",
            "Not that many choices to eat so do not come here hungry.\n",
            "Burger and Beer week. The chop house burger and Bodhi beer for $6. Get fries for $1 more. The cook to order burger was delicious - cheese, bacon, spinach, fried onion, and Miller's steak sauce and topped with a pickle slice on the bun. The sweet potato fries were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The staff is friendly and professional. You will not be disappointed.\n",
            "Charming, cute place with beautiful kind people. The food is delicious! The tables idea guacamole was the BEST I have ever had! We will be back for the fresh food again!!\n",
            "Great place to come eat. One of my favorite places to eat in Quincy. Hotspot buffet is amazing. Must try.\n",
            "Very laid back vibe with eclectic menu (venison meatloaf and Bake Brie at same place) and great drink menu\n",
            "\n",
            "Newly graduated professionals sitting shoulder to shoulder with Baby Boomers enjoying a nice peaceful evening with good food and drink- this is your place if that sounds inviting\n",
            "We love the house barrel wine. Food is yummy too. The wait staff is great also.  They changed how they cooked some of our favorite items and it is not the same. Hate when restaurant change how they make something and it turns out not for the better.\n",
            "About 18 months ago, I visited La Bottega and the food was OK at best.  I vowed never to return.\n",
            "\n",
            "For some reason, my wife suggested that we try it again so we went last week and was pleasantly surprised by the great service and food.  I asked Jen, our server (who is wonderful and very efficient) whether they hired a new executive chef because the quality of the food was remarkable.  She indicated that the sous chef was elevated to executive chef which in my opinion was a very strategic decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "We returned last night (a week night) and it was extremely busy with hardly an empty table.  We ordered the roast duck which was absolutely out of this world -- tender and moist.  The restaurant has been added to my list of \"go to\" restaurants.  It is by far the best Italian restaurant north of the Columbia River.\n",
            "I live in the area and this is one of my favorite bars to go to. The beer selection is massive with all of the draft offerings and they have even more in bottles and a great liquor selection. Plus the staff is very knowledgeable about the various drafts in how they taste. Not to mention they are amazingly kind. \n",
            "\n",
            "The food is great as well and very, very cheap. This is the perfect place to come and spend the night with a group of friends to watch any game/just drink the night away while enjoying a great burger.\n",
            "The ramen, miso broth, and pork were sublime.  Truly a great dish.  I liked sitting at the community table.  Do forget to try the goyza, they are delicate little (they really are nicely sized) pocket of pork nirvana.  The sauce that they have on the table is also amazing.  Will be going here once a week for sure.\n",
            "Delicious! I went to Sunday brunch with family and had some amazing food. We all tried each other's plates too. The Benedict was great; I say this having disliked \"easy\" cooked egg yolks my whole life but devouring the whole plate.\n",
            "I suggest asking how big each menu item is because the frittata is enough for two or three small people, but so delicious.I would go back in an instant. \n",
            "Great presentation and the hosts/waiters were just the right amount of attentive.\n",
            "This was my first time at this restaurant and I do not regret it. I only wish I had more people with me so we could have ordered more. The Lechon margarita and mal humorado drinks hit the spot. They were flavorful without tasting booze. The food was equally as delicious. I enjoyed the pork tacos, the cerviche and the empanadas. The chips served with the cerviche were the best thinnest and crispest I have ever had. I would come back again in a heartbeat if I lived in Portland. The bartenders were friendly and attentive.\n",
            "While they do not have their full menu during the soft opening, the tonkotsu ramen served on Sunday was delicious!\n",
            "And so was the karaage/chicken.\n",
            "I will definitely back for more.\n",
            "My husband and I love coming here. Service is on point the food is great and the drinks are Fabulous.\n",
            "Prezza is me and my wife's go to for Valentine's Day each year and it never fails. It is expensive but it is worth it. I have had some of my favorite meals at this restaurant. The staff is friendly and the service is top notch. The bar is great too. This is my favorite place in the North End and that is saying a lot!\n",
            "Just had an exceptional experience at this restaurant. Food was amazing but even more amazing was the service. Ask for Laurent if you go. He went above and beyond and was absolutely on top of things.\n",
            "Great food, great cocktails, even better service. Thanks Hayley :)\n",
            "\n",
            "Chicken and waffles was the jam--my boyfriend got the fried chicken meal which was HUGE and delicious also. Yummy Mac n cheese came with that... Mimosas and Bloody Mary's hit the spot! For our first time, this place was great. We will definitely be back for more!\n",
            "One of the best restaurants in Vancouver! Authentic atmosphere, authentic staff, authentic food. \n",
            "\n",
            "Mussels & Fries - Only served on Wednesdays, which is why we literally only come here on Wednesdays. Tastes as good, if not better, than what we have had in Europe.\n",
            "Assiette de Charcuterie & Assiette de Fromages - Absolutely delicious. It is really hard to find good charcuterie so make sure you get some while you are here.\n",
            "Just amazing food! It reminded us of the pizza we ate in Amalfi, Italy! We got the prosciutto pizza and mushroom risotto! Sooo yumm! I wish we could try more things here! Great service, the lady we had was so sweet and attentive! Great beer on draft!\n",
            "This place is hands down the best in Texas! I love their ribs!!! They did short us on 1lb of meat but it was a Friday night and they were slammed. Expensive mistake but the food was still amazing\n",
            "One of the most fun aspects of this place is sitting at the low seat bar and watching the staff make the dishes, whilst of course conversing occasionally with the gents making the drinks. \n",
            "\n",
            "The plates are artfully assembled and pack a punch of strong, uniquely combined tastes. My wife and I shared the Gulf Shrimp, Stuffed Pasta, and Ribeye. It was delightful to savor each individual flavor, but so much more to experience the explosion of them all together as they hit the tongue at their various times and textures. \n",
            "\n",
            "The drink menu is not for those who like sweet (a good thing in my opinion). It is strong, tart, yet smooth; if you get sweet be sure it will be followed by bitter. Sipping beverages. \n",
            "\n",
            "It was a delightful experience to take in the modern, trendy decor and music generating a cool, comfortable, not pretentious atmosphere along with the dishes and drinks assembled for adults who want beautiful blows of taste in the tongue. \n",
            "\n",
            "For my wife and I, I believe this may be our new date spot!\n",
            "I came here my first time and ordered the \"giant taco omelette\". Giant does not even begin to describe the size. The omelette contains 8-12 eggs and tasted great it also came with a piece of French toast which was also very very good. This is definitely a shareable plate for 2-3 people. Great service as well.\n",
            "Yumm. Thai Dish is definitely my favorite Thai place north of NYC. The service is always great, and I have never had a dish there that I did not like. All of their vegetables are fresh, and that adds a nice touch to their delicious curries. \n",

            "My fiance loves the fried rices, and has had the Crispy Chicken dish, which was also really tasty. You really cannot go wrong here!\n",
            "I echo the love for the linguini with the asparagus creme sauce! It is the richest, dairy-free sauce I have ever had, and cannot be beat. The staff is all super friendly and helpful, and very accomodating to my vegetarian diet and my friends gluten free diet. I will be back again! And again!\n",
            "So I have been to the dallas location many times. I just moved to Austin hoping that this location would be up to par, and it absolutely was. Personally, I prefer the atmosphere and location to that of dallas. Parking is a little tricky, but it is nice to walk around the little area anyway - lots of graffiti art and cute shops. The food, incredible. Got the tots, which are covered in toppings, sauce, and a fried egg, and my personal favorite, the angus beef taco. My boyfriend got the Tikka chicken, which I tried, and it was equally amazing. They offer really neat and unique drinks, staff was friendly, service was fast. I would not recommend going on a weekend night however, as there are hundreds of very drunk, very sloppy people in the area. The other bars play music extremely loudly which makes a nice enjoyable outing a little less nice. They still did a great job with their service and food though, and were polite and patient even though I am sure they would had plenty of exhausting customers that evening. I look forward to my next visit!\n",
            "Best Chinese restaurant I have had in Austin. Do yourself a favor and go here if you are even remotely close to the area. \n",

            "The dumplings, lamb skewers, and green onion pancakes are incredible. My girlfriend does not like Asian food, but this place is the exception. She actually requests the dumplings multiple times a month.\n",
            "Dooley's is FUN.  It is an Irish pub that actual feels like just that: a pub that is in Ireland.  The big draw at Dooley's is the music.  One regular act is a guy who sings, appropriately, rude and ribald pub songs (the crowd likes to sing along when they know the tune).  Another is two guys that play great traditional Irish music on guitar and fiddle.\n",
            "We live in Northern Virginia and my daughters wanted Mexican after spending the day at Universal Studios. She used Yelp on her android phone to search and we found this hidden gem in a strip mall. We drove by twice but decided to trust Yelp. Great Decision! \n",

            "One of my daughters described what she wanted and the great lady taking the order - created the option. I had the chalk board special - which was a beef enchilada special - it was excellent (we use to live in TX). My wife had tacos with different fiilings. The girls tried a couple of juices, which she recommended. The total bill was around $30 for the four of us. One of daughters wanted a smoothie and she even recommended where I could drive to get one for her! \n",

            "Super Service!\n",
            "fantastic burgers. great ingredients, great execution. extremely efficient operation for such a busy place. their milkshakes are stupid good. llano poblano burger is my fave, but there is not a bad thing on the menu.\n",
            "When in Vancouver near Esther Short park this is a great place to grab brunch over the weekend. I had the lobster and Brie omelette which was delicious also filled with fresh mushrooms and tomatoes. My companion had the kahlua pork which also looked great. Service was friendly and quick.\n",
            "My husband is here for an allergy conference. He likes the hotel for its proximity to the conference center. It is a short walk under a covered sky bridge. It was a bot too cold in March to swim but it was nice sitting poolside. The main pool was more crowded than the pool on the 4th floor with only had a handful of people lounging there. I also tried out the well equipped gym. We ate at the cafeteria for breakfast and lunch and two of their dining restaurants as well. They were all nice. The hotel also had a food shop where we purchased pastries, coffee, etc. We even microwaved our dog food there. (Yes, they are pet friendly.) The hotel had a full spa but I did not patronize it so cannot comment on that. This is our second stay at this hotel and will not hesitate to stay here again.\n",
            "Excellent, authentic Vietnamese pho and dishes!  Great service.  If you want to have Vietnamese good food, this is the one!\n",
            "Wow, what a treat of a restaurant. The dumplings are amazing. The bubble tea is great for being so far outside the city. Overall the staff are friendly and helpful. Plenty of options for any type of eater. Would definitely recommend to a friend and would go again.\n",
            "Abbondanza II is the fine dining establishment serving nothing but the best Italian cuisine attached to Cafe Abbondanza (the take-out/ pizza portion).  The prices are reasonable, the service is fast and served with a smile.  I would eat there every day if I could.  Be sure to check out their chicken parm!\n",
            "The Ahi burger is sushi grade tuna that has been consistent every time I go.  Been going there for about 2 years, at different times of the day as well as on weekends and week days.  \n",

            "I have to say this place is amazing do you hear me absolutely amazing I enjoyed my meal here with me and my son and I will definitely make this one of my regular stops whenever I want to do breakfast or brunch the atmosphere is so laid-back cozy and welcoming the food is delicious and the customer service is a one so if you happen to be in the outskirts of the downtown area right around the 20 or all the little shops and eateries are located this definitely should be one you put on your list stop to and patronize you will not be disappointed five stars does not give it its just due.\n",
            "Wow.  This place was so good!  The staff was very knowledgeable and polite.  The chicken was amazing!  I have been living in Austin 5 years and this was my first time there.  We will definitely be back!  Only downside is parking, but there is a parking garage close by.\n",
            "I have not been in a while but for a minute there I was getting an order to go for about 3-4 weeks straight--and I do not do that at any one spot in particular.  You cannot miss this place, they have red, blue and white umbrellas and tables just outside the entrance.  The food is SOOOO good, my favorite is pork anything from this establishment!  Every time I went, it was always packed, and it is a very small space.  They only have one server and she is running that place; and they have a young person running the register.  I always get my food to go and the wait for it is probably 10-15 minutes.  I have tried almost all they appetizers and they were all yummy and l like I said, I do mostly pork entrees because you just cannot go wrong with pork!  You can park on the street or there is a private lot just down the block headed south on the same side of the street as the restaurant.\n",
            "Spuds in Saugus has the best,down home food around town. Forget all those fancy places on Rte.1 I had the simple grilled sirloin with mashed potatoes,gravy and brocoli the other day with a small ceasar and it was to die for. So fresh and just like Mom used to make. The price was very reasonable and the service was excellent.\n",

            "Visiting our daughter who just moved to Austin from California. It is our 20th anniversary and we brought all of our kids to Austin to celebrate. Ranch 616 sounded good and the menu looked great. Not a disappointment. We had a reservation and were seated right away. Our waiter, Billy, came right over and was so warm in welcoming us. He suggested great appetizers and drinks to us. Of course, we got the frog legs along with the oysters and calamari....all very tasty. There were nine of us and each one of our meals was spectacular! Dessert was good as well. We met the owner, Kevin, who was very nice and told him what a great place he had. So glad we chose this to celebrate our anniversary. Billy really was one of the best waiters we have ever had. We will definitely be back! Thank you!\n",
            "Six of us went to Riccardo's for a company dinner last night.  I have been there a few times before and this place is consistently very good.  Last night was no exception so I decided I should write a review.  Our waiter, Walter, was awesome.  Very knowledgeable about the food and the wine list and took great care of us.\n",
            "The food was great.  Three of us had a razor clam special (including me) and we all raved about it.  The other three dishes were great too.  I would recommend this place to anyone.\n",
            "So darn good! We had the 5 course chef's special where the chef picks the dishes you eat, you tell them at the beginning if you have any allergies or dislikes and they make it for you. The price was reasonable, the service was out of this world and the drinks were super tasty, I tell all my friends and family to go there. Not to be missed!\n",
            "I am just a little bit obsessed with good lattes to the point that I consider it a failure if I go to a new city and do not make it to at least 4 different coffee shops, and Render's is a delight. (It is definitely helped along by the Gracenote and Counter Culture beans. Yum.) My partner enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and spoke pretty highly of the pourover; the sip he shared left me just as happy.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is also relatively reasonably priced for the area. You will still spend $9 on coffee and a bagel, but you will not find the same quality for any cheaper around here.\n",
            "\n",
            "As in most coffee shops around here, yes, you do have to bus your own dishes; the staff are very kind but also very busy helping other customers. If you want to be waited on, go to SRV.\n",
            "I cannot believe all of the fuddy duddies on here complaining about this place!  Every time I have been it has been a pleasant experience with good, solid food (and lots of it!).  Normally my family goes for brunch, or for a function of some sort (birthday, reception, etc.).  However, last night we went for dinner.  We were seated outside for the supermoon, and the setting was very nice.  \n",
            "\n",
            "My parents got a bottle of wine, and I just had a soda - so I cannot comment on the drinks portion of the experience.  We ordered the calamari to split as an appetizer.  HUGE plate of calamari, lightly battered and not overfried/rubbery, tossed with cherry peppers and served with a huge lemon wedge and a nice zesty dipping sauce.  Easily a meal in itself for one person, and very reasonably priced.\n",
            "\n",
            "For dinner, I had the fisherman's platter (I had been wanting seafood).  What I like most about Inn at Bay Pointe's is that you can tailor it to how you like - you can mix and match between clams (whole-belly), shrimp, scallops, and scrod.  I was craving scallops and fish, so I ordered those two.  Came with a heaping pile of fries, cole slaw, and tartar sauce.  The seafood was again lightly battered and delicious - four big pieces of fish, and 9-10 big sea scallops - I lost count!  Excellent - and the market price rang in at just over $20 for all that!\n",

            "My mom got the stuffed chicken marsala - delicious, and came with grilled mushrooms, and my dad's short ribs were fork tender, in a wonderful sauce served with root vegetables and mashed potatoes.  I only tried a bite of the short ribs, and they were delicious.\n",

            "I cannot say enough about this place - very good food, very good prices, and though somewhat hidden, a nice contrast to going into the city/Marina Bay.\n",
            "Definitely a great place to go for a good pizza, sandwich, or sub. Online ordering is very easy and pick-up is super quick. Great choice if you have one near you. Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is one of the best ones I have had.\n",
            "I almost always come here for Brunch on Saturday! The food is fresh and top quality ingredients are always used in every meal! They allow dogs in the  patio and even have doggie meals on the menu. The staff are always helpful and friendly, even when they are swamped with a wait list of people trying to get a table. The wait is pretty consistent at 30 minutes for a table of two, which is great because you can get a little morning stroll in with a cup of coffee while you wait, and they will text you when your tables ready! Fantastic drinks - highly recommend this lovely brunch spot if your willing to wait and like dogs!\n",
            "First off, the staff are incredible in their friendliness and service. Go there often enough and you become \"Norm\" where they all know your name... that goes for the great customers too! I went once and a customer approached me and everyone else to join in on a surprise birthday song greeting for one of the waiters.\n",
            "The food is typical delicious American fare, served up quickly. Try everything on the menu and you will be back, because it is not just about good food, it is how you are welcomed.\n",
            "Great location, good food, clean and good ambience! I ordered tomato soup and masala dosa, both were sufficient in quantity. Reasonable prices. Would surely come back! :)\n",
            "We just experienced the best Gluten Free Pizza we have ever had. The crust was thin and crisp enough that you could actually hold a slice in your hand. A big deal for GF pizza. The crust a nice taste to it too. Another nice surprise was the fresh, flavorful and organic toppings. Red and yellow peppers that were tender and flavorful as well as the mountains of all beef nitrate free savory pepperoni. The chunky tomato topping was flavorful without being acidic and the caramelized  onions were sweet, not overpowering. Living GF is expensive but after trying the rest, the $18 for my pizza was worth every penny. The hormone free cheese was a nice touch as well.  The salad was fresh and the house made dressing was very good. \n",
            "The raspberry gelato was light and fruity and the chocolate gelato was smooth, light and chocolaty. The service was attentive, efficient and friendly.\n",
            "Finally the lavatories and entire restaurant were nice and clean.\n",
            "Overall 5 stars.\n",

            "Awesome atmosphere at River Pig with great drinks and foods. Aces over Eight and the burger are amazing.\n",
            "I ordered the cucumber and hummus combination with an order of dolma. Simple but great combination. The cucumbers were lightly seasoned with black pepper and salt and their hummus is absolutely delicious. Dolma was also great!\n",
            "Favorite breakfast place in the world. Delicious food and the best Bloody Mary you will find. I really appreciate the many locations! Definitely recommend.\n",
            "We went here for dinner, and got the truffle fries, caesar salad, pan seared half chicken, and a couple beers. Everything was delicious. The chicken was saltier than I was used to, but I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is nice, especially with the baby grand piano. The waitress was attentive. \n",
            "My only complaint was that the kitchen is in the same room as the seating (since it is set up like a coffee shop), so we left the place smelling like cooking oil. Nothing the laundry cannot fix, but if they could figure out a better method of ventilation, this place would be perfect.\n",
            "The brisket and beef ribs were OMG, melt in my mouth, wonderful! There was a line for dinner but it was well worth the wait. The sides were also good but just one tiny gripe is that they have chunks of garlic on their green beans. Garlic makes my stomach ill so I had to pass on my favorite greens. Just like me, it was not cheap but definitely worth the chaching!\n",

            "The food was all fantastic; fresh ingredients, tons of flavor, and everything came out piping hot. We did the \"Pig Out Date\" in order to try a few different things, all of which were delicious. Our favorites were the triple mushu pork (bacon!!) and the \"saki joe.\" We are both pretty serious foodies and yet agreed that the saki joe was one of the best things either of us had ever eaten. Juicy, tender, SUCCULENT bulgogi, crisp/sweet/spicy kimchi pickles with perfect acidity, and air-light sweet potato chips make this balanced sandwich absolutely divine. Will go back just for that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also enjoyed their desserts (vanilla bean parfait and chocolate terrine cake), homemade soda (cherry and ginger FTW!), and craft beer selection.\n",

            "This is one of the best places I have ever eaten! The steak tips are to die for, they have the best arancini balls I have ever had (even better than my Italian grandmother's recipe, which says a lot!) Everything I have ever eaten there has been great. I lived out in Western MA for a few years and this was the place I missed the most! I am glad to be living near it again - The only downside is that its not super cheap and I always end up spending more money than I planned because everything is so good. But it is worth it.\n",
            "By far the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten, and even better - it is inexpensive! \n",
            "\n",

            "From the moment you are greeted to the moment you leave, you are going to love it.  Dinner for two was a bit pricey but we did several courses including desert and after dinner drinks.  \n",
            "The staff was friendly and attentive, and just a touch homey (Not a bad thing at all).  I am not sure who keeps saying the servers were horrible but either they are working against the restaurant or they are too snobby for their own good.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The food was outstanding from the Tuna Poke to the Lavender Lemon Whoopie Pie.  The wine list was approachable with a good selection of wines to choose from, and the house cocktails were delicious. \n",

            "I have been going here since I was like 7 years old. Its my favorite Restaurant. Kind Of a little hole in the wall place nothing fancy but they have the best food of any place like it that I have been to.  I almost always get the teriyaki chicken, Its soo good. The soup is yummy and the salad is bomb, the dressing is so freaken good. You can even buy some in a bottle if you want. They do cook in front of you so if your looking for more of a show then you better go to a place like benihanas instead. But the food is way better then that place.\n",
            "After reading a bunch of reviews, I had to try it.  So a friend and I went over and ordered a 12\" pizza with the Smokin' Joes crust and the spicy sauce and pepperoni, sausage, onion, and tomato.  WOW, was it good!!

My boyfriend and I tried this place because we happened to be doing errands in the area and were pleasantly surprised... actually we were shocked at how good it was.

            "Wowzers, is this place good! I found this place via foursquare looking for Italian and boy was it a find! I was a little pricey (dinner) but it was so worth it. I was ordering a carry-out order and when I asked if they did this the guy kind of sounded surprised but did it (when I got there and saw the white table clothes i understood why they probably do not get a lot of carry-out orders, people go there for the experience as well as the food).  We are dairy (cheese,cream) free and the husband was amazed that delicious Italian could be cheese free (they do *traditional* Italian so no lasagna or alfredo here)! I ordered over the phone based on the menu posted on foursquare and when one of the dishes was not available the guy taking my order ran down the menu and asked what I was looking for (during the dinner rush on a Saturday night mind you). I am confident that I could tell them to make some recommendations for cheese free dishes and they would all be good. Cannot wait to go there for a date night and really peruse the menu and take in the ambiance.\n",

We were disappointed when the kitchen did not have the milk and honey dessert ready when we ordered, but opted for the zeppoli instead. Delicious! Then, before the check came out our waiter brought us the milk and honey on the house as an apology for not having it ready earlier. Delicious food, excellent staff, nice atmosphere. Must visit.\n",
            "I cannot believe we have not eaten here before! Everything we had was SO delicious, from the high quality meat to the vegetables grown right on-site! Things that stood out (other than the excellent menu) were the great patio out back and our server, Alex. He made the experience even better with his sincerity, prompt service, and friendly demeanor. We will definitely be back soon!\n",
            "Oh...my...gawd. The mushroom sandwich is to die for!  The bartenders are fantastic, been the best I have come across in PDX so far. I have been to Muu-Muu's three times in the 8 weeks I have been in the neighborhood, and will continue to go. Love this place!\n",
            "Stopped by on a Sunday evening to check out the new place in town & we are so happy we did. We were greeted & seated immediately though it was moderately busy. They brought complimentary garlic knots which were good - yeasted bread & real garlic, crunchy outside, soft inside. We had pizza  which was excellent in a simple thin crust way. The prices were good and though we had no wine, their list had a good selection. The music was a mix of Rat Pack crooners mixed with light rock (which seemed a little weird), at a good volume.  We will definitely be back!\n",

            "Great food. Great prices. Some of the best Borracho beans in Austin. The lunch special is also probably the best value for a weekday work lunch.\n",
            "I absolutely love Wolf's Ridge. The brunch is the best in Columbus! The staff is very friendly. I also enjoy the taproom. They have a much wider selection of beer in their taproom. It is a great place for pre or post dinner drinks\n",
            "The best donuts I have ever had, hands down!! I ordered the coconut cream and the blueberry basil and they were both to die for. The coconut cream tasted like coconut milk and  you can really taste the basil in the blueberry donut. I liked how fresh the donuts are here. I highly suggest trying both!!\n",
            "\n",
            "I also ordered the peach champagne, dulce de leche and hazelnut and passion fruit to go. I liked the dulce de leche donut but was not fond of the peach champage because the champagne was too strong and the passion fruit was too sour.\n",
            "My friend and want here. The people here are so kind. They laugh, they joke around, they were warm. They sell nooner sizes of every type of beer for around $2, with a literal wall of taps. Adrian was super sweet, and we were wowed by Kendell, our bartender. My frimom me is a vegetarian so we made a tapas plate out of their seriously tasty Mac n cheese, the mushrooms had amazing flavor and the Parmesan zucchini was yum. They have this hot sauce called slow burn which was really good. Kendell often greeted people by name around me. Man, this place has that warm, family feeling between everyone else that made you not hate yourself the second you walk in the door.\n",

            "Loved everything I put in my mouth.  Great Bloody Mary that had kind of a sweet/spicy taste.  The salsa and chips appetizer was delicious with unique chips and three salsas.  The calamari was served with a mustard vinaigrette....a switch from normal marinara but well done.  I had the short rib hash and it was amazing!  Also tried bites of my friends' dishes (the crab cake benedict and carrot cake French toast) and both were delicious.  The French toast is served with a yummy pecan cream cheese. \n",

            "This place has a very cool vibe. There was a pool table, a jute box, and pinball machines. The bartenders were really attentive and creative. Peter was awesome and created a unique drink for me after I told him what I typically like, he even went as far to make it look cool in a tiki glass with a flower!\n",

            "Came here for a quick lunch with my husband, and we will be back! I had the chicken gyro, he had the regular. Both were very good and a good value. The service was fast and very friendly. Looking forward to exploring the menu a bit more!\n",

            "We had the salsa sampler with the queso flameado, the migas, the endive and spinach salad, and the wild boar pozole. We drank an infused Bloody Mary, a Ginger Mango Mimosa, and a Paraty. Everything was absolutely amazing, I would recommend it all!\n",
            "Never in years of Legal Seafood dedication have I had a bad meal here, EVER. A crab roll comes on a buttered & grilled roll so light it is almost ethereal. Really it is an amazing roll and just amplifies the quality of the crabmeat. \n",

            "Punjab Palace is by far my favorite Indian restaurant. The food is delicious, the staff very courteous and attentive, and the prices cannot be beat especially at lunch time. We usually get 2 main dishes, an appetizer, naan, and a non-alcoholic drink, all for about $30. The Shahi Paneer is the best I have had anywhere.\n",
            "Sharon was our server and she was great! We came in at a weird time just for a bite to eat. I got the fish tacos and my friend got some sort of bean bowl. Both were great. Really cool decor. Defiantly want to come back at night some time.\n",
            "Our server here at iPICs in the lounge area tonight, Jess P was very friendly and helpful in recommending food selections before our movie. She was presently social without being intrusive which is a rare skill to find in service staff today. She will do well and you would be lucky to have her for your server to top off a excellent experience at the movies. For a few extra dollars the movie experience  here at iPics is much much more enjoyable than your standard stadium affair,\n",
            "Of all the restaurants I have tried since moving to Colorado, this place really is the gem in my eyes, everything they cook, they do perfectly. My go to breakfast is the Pain Perdue, it is such a simple dish but done so right, always a good sign of quality.\n",
            "Some people want to hang out at a café where they can sit for hours with a large bubble of personal space - which is a legit priority, but that is not Nine Bar.  However, if you want the best espresso drink offered within Davis Square, then bypass every other spot, and bring your butt to Nine Bar.  I have fallen into a blissful stupor at my breve lattes.  I bow to the baristas - thanks!  Make better coffee and Nine Bar your resolution, and you will have a fantastic 2017!!!\n",

            "I have never had a bad experience here. The staff are extremely friendly and enthusiastic more often than not and they always give generous portions! I live very close so I visit this Babylon café frequently and they have still never given me a reason to doubt the quality of their food or service, so that should say alot.\n",
            "Austin is seriously lacking in the Italian food department so thank GOD for Gusto. It is exactly the kind of restaurant I had been searching for when in the mood for a dark, intimate and comforting Italian evening. \n",
            "\n",
            "The place is pretty small so be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends. Exposed brick walls, beautiful paintings, candle lit tables; it is classy without feeling fancy or fake. They have a great selection of craft cocktails, beer and wine for reasonable prices. My fiance and I ordered a wonderful bottle of red for dinner that I believe was under $20 (cannot quite remember; we finished the thing). \n",
            "\n",
            "The menu is excellent and offers a variety of classic Italian staples to satisfy your need for traditional fare, as well as new dishes to keep you interested. We struggled with our decisions because everything just sounded so wonderful! We started with the mussels - always a good idea. Delicious buttery white wine broth and perfectly cooked. For the main courses, we ordered the Mushroom Truffle Risotto and Italian Job Pizza. That risotto was by far the creamiest, most luxurious dish I have ever tasted at a restaurant. Forget truffle mac & cheese and mashed potatoes - this is the real deal. The Italian Job pizza was also excellent - rich, flavorful sauce, tasty sausage and big dollops of fresh goat cheese. Oh and the crust (obviously the most important part) is great. Thin and bubbly with brick oven flavor and just a slight bite of dough to keep it from being too crisp. \n",
            "\n",
            "At this point, we were full (and pretty tipsy) but I had to order the Tiramisu for dessert (such a sucker for that one). UGH - greatness. Rich and velvety with the perfect balance of coffee, rum and sweet cream flavor. A great way to end the perfect Italian night.\n",
            "Wow!! Jose and Cecilia made our dining experience amazing!! They both had personality and great suggestions!! Our steaks were perfect!! Highly recommend!!\n",
            "They did not have California rolls or any seeweed ready so I had to eat something else. I felt really upset because I was hungry and really wanted sushi! The cashier was really nice and offered to make more, but it would take 15 minutes. I settled on something else..then out of nowhere a few minutues later the cashier dropped off complimentary California rolls to me. It made my night :-)\n",
            "I went in for ramen, wound up ordering katsu don curry and takoyaki. It was great. I had been craving Japanese curry for awhile and was shocked to see it on the menu. Happy, but shocked. The service was great. Food was great. Cannot wait to go back!\n",
            "I love this restaurant. The service is not excellent, but the food is. The masitas is my favorite with the banana frita.\n",
            "Great food and very nice staff. Lately I have been ordering out for pickup a lot, because I cannot get enough of the tofu vegetable pho. I have to say that it is the best pho I have ever had. Everything is well balanced, and there is a wide range of vegetables that are in the dish. I should probably try ordering something else at some point, but every time I go there I just want the pho. Needless to say I highly recommend it.\n",

            "Originally drew me in with their beautiful greenery outside the restaurant with huge open doors and an airiness about the restaurant! Hostess was super attentive and i got seated right away. Love the nautical flare!! On my first visit I was coming from a weekend on the beach in casual shorts and a top but did not feel underdressed or uncomfortable in such a nice restaurant (so nice that it does not have that stuffy feeling right!?) Had the freshest yellowtail from the raw bar, halibut with amazing polenta and tasty tomatoes, mushroom pizza (GREAT vegetarian choice, super filling without feeling like you ordered the only veg option on menu thanks chef!)\n",
            "\n",
            "Both times the manager came over and introduced himself (not in that obtrusive nosy way but very genuine) asked me how everything was thanked me for my business and invited me back! \n",

            "Overall HIGHLY recommend, cannot wait to return with an occasion to celebrate or simply to grab a bite after work at this convenient, fresh restaurant with fabulous service!\n",
            "The Barking Crab is right on the water. Good luck getting a table, but it is well worth it. The food is great and there is a great outdoor deck atmosphere. Lobster Roll was excellent. Beer selection also terrific. I loved the Crabby Lager.\n",
            "Amazing! Every single sides we took was delicious. Surprisingly the short ribs were the highlights\n",
            "The jerk chicken was everything I hoped it would be. The goat was delicious too. I am so glad this place opened\n",
            "I am by no means an expert on the area, being from out of town, but this restaurant really stood out from the other food options in the Market. We found this place right after we had eaten a terrible lunch at the food court and actually sat down just because our baby woke up and needed some food. We ended up being so tempted by the menu that it turned into second lunch!\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "The wine list is all Canadian and is a lot of fun. I am not going to say that these are world class wines, but the sample prices are reasonable and we had a good time being introduced to some British Columbia wines we had not heard of before. If you are looking to do a tour of BECAUSE wines but are not heading out to the vineyards, I highly recommend a flight of wines from Edible Canada.\n",
            "\n",
            "We were so intrigued by the menu we ended up ordering the spring salad. It was a delight with quail egg, bacon, green beans and young goat cheese. Everything was very fresh and flavourful. The dressing was nice and light. The only thing that could have made it better was if the quail egg had been seasoned separately before added to the salad because it could have used just a dash more salt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Too bad we were full, we would have tried the grilled cheese or  roast pork sandwich (with bacon on top!). Both looked appetizing (on the menu and on other diner's tables).\n",
            "\n",
            "The atmosphere was relaxed but classy and the communal tables add some fun. I can see why other reviewers have hosted little get-togethers here. There are some criticisms in other reviews about the service, not our experience at all - they were fantastic. \n",
            "\n",
            "The price point is just right for a sit down lunch and a good value when you take into account the quality of the offerings. Highly recommend.\n",
            "Damn good chicken menu here. The food cart pod is a month old but there are many choices. I had the Clucken Hot Chicken Sandwich and it was very good.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and had the most wonderful experience. From start to finish it was flawless. Food and drinks were delicious and the service was outstanding.\n",
            "Good Beer, and probably one of the best brewery open air patios in town. The bartenders are always nice and able to give a good recommendation for what to drink. Great place to sit in the sun and people watch on Mississippi Ave.\n",
            "We had such a great experience here for lunch.  Our servers were kind and attentive, and even brought out complimentary hummus with fresh pitas.  I was torn on what to order but eneded up with the artichoke chicken and it was amazingggg.  My hubby had the lamb platter which he devoured.  It is maybe a little pricey for lunch ($12-$14) but they give huge portions so it is worth it.\n",
            "Love the vibe at School House. It is relaxed and I can actually hear and talk to the people I am with. I especially like the happy hour specials, which are everyday and pretty varied. I cannot remember the name of the drink with blackberries, but it was my favorite!\n",

            "The first time I went, I was very skeptical...got some Eggplant Parm...turned out pretty damn awesome. It is not the hardest thing to make, so I had to go again. I have gone through the Saltimbocca, Puttanesca, Breaded Chicken Sandwich, and a few more. Each time I go, it gets better and better. I do not even like sweet sauces all that much, or olives/capers, but in their dishes, they were awesome. \n",
            "\n",
            "The pasta tastes just as good as a lot of the stuff from the North End...and that is saying something. While it might be a little pricey for the rest of the hill, it is very worth it. Much cheaper than going to the North End. If you have not gone to Lilly's yet, do it. It really is damn good. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you do not know what you want, ask the Exec. Chef/Owner, he is generally there and he hits the nail on the head each time I go in. The past 3 times I have gone in, I just give him a general idea of what I am feeling, and let him pick for me. He is awesome and dedicated to making the best food he can. Cannot recommend this place enough right now.\n",
            "Its been a while since I have updated my Shenanigans review so I decided after my last delicious trip in for lunch that I would hit it up. Stopped in here with the boy while I did my laundry next door to Baileys. While I have moved to the Fort Point side of Southie now, I still hop in my car to Shenanigans pretty often. \n",
            "The service is always great. I really have never had one bad experience service wise at any time. I have gone in on Saturday nights as much as I have stopped in for a cure to my hangover on a Sunday afternoon. The bartenders are quick, friendly and know how to mix a drink. \n",
            "The food? Its actually really friggin good. I swear! Not good as in \"good for pub food\" good... good as in genuinely delicious. Their burgers are juicy and piled high with cheese and irish bacon (just the way I like it). If a menu offers irish bacon on a burger, it pretty much has already won my heart. \n",
            "They run great daily specials and their brunch/breakfast is wonderful too. Good run at the Irish breakfast too. \n",
            "SO if you were like me, abusing Shenanigans the way I abuse my right as a woman to change my mind, my clothes and my hair color... think again. Stop in on an off day and see what you are missing!\n",
            "I came here with my friend on a Thursday afternoon! It was pleasantly quiet and there were only a couple people chatting and sipping on their drinks. I ordered a delicious Cortado which was made perfectly and came with tonic water. My friend ordered a Matcha Green Latte. I tried it and it was also perfectly made, a little on the sweeter side, but was creamy and a good portion. There was also a cute little message at the bottom of the cup. Although it is a bit on the pricey side, I would say that the drinks were definitely worth it. \n",
            "\n",
            "My favorite part about my visit to the cafe was the excellent customer service. The employees were so friendly and helpful. They offered my friend and I a complimentary hot chocolate and it was absolutely delicious. I loved it even more than my Cortado! It was the perfect amount of chocolate, at the perfect temperate with a perfect design on top. So so so so delicious. I would definitely recommend the hot chocolate for anyone who is not looking for a coffee drink! \n",

            "Unfortunately I have only been there 3 times. During my most recent visit I bought almost 1 of everything (2 and 3 of some) to bring home to East Boston to share with my friends and family.  Ordering was quick, and easy and food was ready to go in no time at all. Everyone loved the food . We all got to taste a little of everything. Ordering to go was good because if i ate in, I would have trouble picking one type of sandwich/burger. Delicious!  I will be back July 29th after our Boston3Day event. Cannot wait.\n",

She brought our coffee and water and asked us if we had been in before.  I said no.  She broke the menu down for us and explained some of the items.  From greeting to bringing us the check she was present and engaging.  To that point I must say that all the staff were really friendly and seemed to enjoy their job but we were being waited on by Shay and i want to be sure she is singled out!\n",

            "     When you first pull into the parking lot it can be very tempting to just drive away.  The exterior of the building is a bright yellow and looks really dirty.  Usually you will find people panhandling or selling junk outside the entrance.  The restaurant is attached to a meat market so be sure to read the correct sign so you visit the correct place.  And make sure you actually go in! \n",
            "\n",
            "     Inside the restaurant when you first walk in you feel a sense of relief.  I was actually shocked at how clean it was, especially after the not so good first impression of the outside.  \n",
            "\n",
            "     Service was on the slow side, and this goes for both visits I had.  They have a huge selection of fresh juices I tried the lime aid and could not get enough!  All meals come with chips and salsa.  The salsa is delicious, it is puréed very fine and seasoned well.  My main course was the wet burrito.  This burrito was one of the best.  Huge! My only complaint was the meat was somewhat crunchy.  Other than that the rice, beams cheese and sauce was perfect.\n",
            "This has been a regular stop for my family since it opened a few years ago. (I think the first time we went was during their first week of business.)  We have probably eaten here once a month on average for the last four years.\n",

            "The salad bar is huge with plenty of options for meat lovers and vegetarians. The way Churrascaria works is a process in which after the salad bar, you have a red/green card on the table. Use the green side facing up so the meat servers come around and offer you different delicious marinated meats on a skewer. Save lots of room for meat because it is unlimited all you can eat!\n",
            "To say it was the best airport food I have ever eaten would be a gross understatement.  This restaurant would thrive in any metro area and sets the standard for \"terminal cuisine\".  I had the salmon bruscetta and the mountain chicken with creamed sushi rice. Both were spectacular.  Nothing ruins your day like a long layover in the ATL airport, but if you have to be in the airport, you should definitely be here.  Cannot wait to come back\n",
            "Best Bacon in Portland! Oh yeah, there is a maple glazed donut under it! I know there is another famous place in Portland that has Maple Bacon donut, but here is the difference. Blue Star's version was prepared right in front of me, in a very clean, ocd clean kitchen, each donut flavor was displayed in a very nice clean case, a clean, kind and very helpful cashier helped us with our order. We sat at a clean, freshly washed down counter. We tried three flavors and enjoyed each very much. Each one was cooked perfectly, nice texture, plenty of sweet glaze, unusual flavor combinations were available. I thought it was cool to go to a donut shop with the off the wall, downtown scene with unususl folks and off odors, I  have changed my mind. I think Blue Star donuts is a place that will be on every travel bloggers you must go to list when in Portland. \n",
            "\n",
            "I agree with Jenn B.and Tommy C. this is not your average grocary store donut, if you want to have something special, this is it. They did not have any of the creme brule so I know I will be back and they are next door to Lardo and around the corner from Tasty & Alder. This will soon be the center of Portland, ground zero for 5 star ratings from me.\n",
            "From start to finish, an overall wonderful experience.  We had a party of 10 for a birthday celebration and were seated within 5 minutes of arrival without any questions whatsoever.  The waitstaff were courteous, prompt, and the portions were outstanding.  The quality of the food was superb and the end of the meal was completed with an Ethiopian coffee service which was not ordered, but sincerely appreciated.  The coffee was very authentic in its taste!  We had brought a sheet cake and the waitstaff took it upon themselves to surprise the birthday girl with it, candles fully lit!  Without hesitation, I recommend Bahel to anyone who is looking for great Ethiopian food in addition to wonderful and warm service.  I have tried many an Ethiopian restaurant in Atlanta, and have finally found the perfect combination of everything in a dining experience that I have been looking for.\n",
            "We started with the Lobster Guacamole, which my spouse said was the best thing ever! I agree! It had huge chunks of the most delicious lobster piled on top of super yummy guacamole! So good! I had the Picante Margarita which was nice & spicy & fantastic! The Fajitas were the best we have ever had too! The steak and chicken were high quality, tender and cooked perfectly! LOVED our server Adrienne! So nice & friendly:) We will be back!!!\n",
            "Love love love this place! I eat here for lunch at least 3 times a week, and every time the food is amazing! I tried few things, and never been disappointed. The wait could get a little ridiculous at times, but that does not stop people from coming in. The atmosphere is nice, both the guy and girl who work at the register is super nice and very helpful with food selection. The noodle soup is delicious, and so is spicy beef. Definitely a lunch spot to try!!\n",

I offered three times to pay the postage to have it returned, but Amanda Johnson refused my money and sent it to me FedEx, presumably at her own expense. This is WAY above the call of duty and I was so impressed I called and spoke to the manager.  Next time I am in Tigard, I know where I am going to eat, and I recommend everyone support this awesome business.  Thank you Amanda and Red Robin!!\n",

I asked for a well-done burger, because I feel like the Beyond Burger patties they use tend to be a little greasy if they are \"undercooked\", and it was perfect!  I am really glad to know this place exists and we will absolutely return.\n",

We were served desert and champagne on the house because we were celebrating our anniversary.  Our server took pictures of us to preserve the wonderful memories.  We enjoyed the Harvest special and I had the short ribs which were so good.  I would definitely go back again!\n",

The piadina was really yummy, nice and crispy with an even veggie to cheese ratio. Fruit cup really surprised me, it had a really great mixture of fruit (grapes, pineapples, apples, cantaloupe, grapefruit) and it was really fresh too! I will be back for sure\n",

My wife and I are fans of the big Monica's, but the Trattoria is a hidden gem that is one of the best simple and excellent restaurants in the city. Yes, it has a smaller wine list and yes, it has less items of the menu but what it does not have is tourists, mama mia food and pushy servers. I was just there for restaurant week and the food was, as always, excellent. The seating is a little tight and they do not have a bar  (I do not know if you can even get beer) but they do have wine and other non alcoholic drinks. Get there early and you will have more room to yourself. Highly recommended!\n",

John is always there and is interactive with his customers. There was just one small problem, I  think that the Manager was very rude to our waitress. She yelled at her about being behind the bar getting our drinks. Ashley always makes are drinks when we come in to have lunch . Other then this our food and service is always a wonderful experience.\n",
            "Thai Cuisine is my go to lunch spot when I take lunch during the weekdays for work.   They are a hidden gem of a Thai restaurant in a strip center on Parmer Ln.  They are one of the top 5 Thai restaurants in town I think. I have only been for lunch. During lunch you order off the menu plus they have a buffet bar that you get all you can eat soup (usually 2 to pick from), pot stickers, spring rolls, and a salad bar. So you get all that along with your meal. It is an awesome deal. They get quite business during lunch so I try to get there before noon so I can get a table. For the amount of great food you get for the price this place is a super deal.  You cannot go wrong trying out Thai Cuisine for lunch.\n",

            "I ate at a FIGO down near L5P in ATL once and was thoroughly unimpressed, but this one in Dunwoody was like a completely different restaurant.  We placed our orders ahead of time, but instead of arriving to a table full of tepid food, we were warmly greeted, ushered to our tables, and the entire staff immediately started bringing out drinks, hot bread with infused olive oil for dipping, salads, appetizers... I had barely killed half an Arnold Palmer and nommed 3 pieces of ciabatta before they served me my Mista Di Campo salad, which is a fairly simple salad with balsamic dressing.  The greens were fresh and green.  I know that lacks adjectives, but I hate white lettuce.  These were definitely very green, and tender.  It had a ricotta that was actually pretty flavorful and long curly q's of carrot, also tomatoes and either really dark Kalamata olives or really tasty black ones ;)  The salad was large.  I thought they brought me the wrong size until I saw the same salad in a large, and it was huge.  For lunch I had the panini vegetariano, which if you could not tell is Italian for 'veggie sammich', and, ironically if you dropped me alone in the middle of Italy, are the same words I would use to ask for food in a mildly ignorant American way.  \"Yo necesito panini vegetariano prego?\"  Funny jokes aside, the panini was on point- fresh ciabatta with eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, goat cheese and pesto.  Basically 6 of my favorite things.\n",
            "The servers brought out a steady stream of dishes until well after the time I had completely finished eating my salad and sandwich and bread and like 10 bites of other peoples food.  I seriously thought surely everyone else was done too but they were actually just getting to their pasta courses.  It was like a 45 minute crash course in Italian food.  If you like Italian I know you are saying, \"Yes please\" right now.\n",
            "I do not give out a lot of 5 star ratings, and I probably have never given one like this, where I had a crappy experience at a different location in the same chain, but they really had it together at FIGO, and I hope you can have the same caliber of food and service that I had if or when you go.\n",

Just when you think you have hit all the good places, not that there are many bad places in the North End.  Hands down one of the best places in the neighborhood, and that is coming from an Italian.  Their menu has quite a variety depending on your mood.  The appetizers were creative & delicious.  For the main course I actually got the sirloin, which is not typical for me at an Italian restaurant.  My wife got this halibut dish that was probably the best  have ever tasted.  I was happy she could not finish her food because then I got to enjoy surf & turf, ha!!  Needless to say if you are looking for a new place to try in the North End then give this place a shot.

She was the perfect, welcoming introduction to Vancouver for us. Oh. And the view was just beautiful as well.\n",
            "Yes, the food is as good as everyone says it is.  Very nice folks cooking and serving, too.  We do not get out to the SW side of town very often (at least by choice) but this spot would be worth driving over to on the weekend for lunch.\n",
            "On a pricey side, but totally worth it! The presentation of the food as well as quality and flavors were amazing. Will definitely be back if enroute through Atlanta again!\n",
            "2nd time here, Had the filet and creamed spinach last night, and it was outstanding again. Outstanding service too!\n",
            "Stopped by for a quick family dinner and they seemed very on top of things. Some guy in the back seemed very invested in getting orders out quickly. Our food came out quickly, was accurate and tasted good. \n",

            "Wonderful, formal afternoon tea.  Classy, elegant, the best outside of being in London.   Service is impeccable, delicious sandwiches and tea cakes, and the tea itself is awesome.  They even do a tea for younger people so that they can enjoy a great tradition.  I really enjoyed it.  Go with a girlfriend and then head to Bella Sante for a spa day!\n",

            "Visiting Rockport area on spring break and fell upon this gem.   Pizza was superb.  We had the recommended white pizza with broccoli, chicken and garlic yum! and also tried the sausage pizza...the sauce was very good too.  Living in CT close to NY and New Haven where they really know how to make pizza we were not sure what to expect from the Boston area.  The sirloin tips were also fabulous...the cherry peppers an added bonus.\n",

It is the type of sauce that makes you return for more days later. Their hot sauce is superb, flavorful, sticks great to the wings. The wing size is on the small size however the taste is enough to have you back for more. I have been here a handful of times in the past couple weeks and they are consistent.\n",

Both times I was in a booth close to the kitchen.  The three or four working in the kitchen make less noise than I do cooking alone at home.  The wait staff does not spend spend time chatting with each other.  \n",

I have to commend them on two things: first, the curry was not too strong (which is especially important if it is going to be in soup form, so kudos to them); second, the handmade noodles were killer.

Texture is everything when it comes to noodles, and this place does an admirable job, especially with the udon (I have had the soba, but they are not handmade.

The last time I went here, I spotted the owner cleaning up a table after the customers had left. He also took some time to (in an endearing way) watch me eat my food, and I am sure he took delight in me slurping his pride and joy up and into my tummy.\n",
            "\n",

            "Best chicken around. You do have to wait longer but that is because they cook their chicken to order more times than not. Great family run business. They also serve the best chicken nuggets ever and no other mfc has them. It also comes with \"white sauce\" which tastes soooo good like Kobe. It tastes so good I buy it by the quart and bring it home!!!\n",

The service is very in-depth but slow. The explain the entire menu for you which is nice and helpful. There specials are all incredible and the ambiance is great. The only qualm, is it is a bit pricey, but totally worth it once you eat there.\n",
            "We came here once for the tomato and corn festival.  It was delicious!!!!  With your ticket, you get to eat as much tomatoes and corn you wanted.   There was a huge variety of tomatoes- green, yellow, red ones and more.  The corn on the cob was just as good.  Nice marketplace to pick up some other vegetables.  We have not found a farm nearby that has done such as nice job with festivals like this one.\n",

            "As for pho, I have had the Pho Ga (chicken, of course) and it is pretty good.  They serve it with a flat, thicker style noodle here - similar to fettucine but in rice form.  The chicken is sliced (not pulled) white meat and fairly abundant.  They come with a large quantity of the accoutrements of Pho - cilantro, peppers, basil, bean sprouts, etc.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The only downside is that I rarely see any utensils other than Pho spoons and chopsticks, which would be helpful with the chicken and rice dish, as it does not come sliced.  Other than needing a knife, I am very content at this spot!  Good service, very efficient and easy on the wallet.  Parking in Boston, especially Chinatown is difficult as well as expensive if you go garage.  I would suggest taking the T - orange line and it is about 300 feet from there.\n",

            "Everything is wonderful from there pastas, fish, seafood, and desserts. They make a talapia with a saffron sauce that is to die for. The bread should be on the food network show best thing I ever ate. Must go if you want to eat Italian food and you are in Austin.\n",
            "I ordered lunch to go from this place for myself and my coworkers. The food was very good! Fresh and well made. The staff and the manager were very inviting the minute I walked in and even catered to some special requests for the order. Everyone enjoyed the food and I will be back soon!\n",
            "Curra's has my favorite breakfast in all of Austin- \"loaded\" queso with a potato, bacon and cheese taco. My fiance also really likes a chorizo, egg and cheese taco, which is also delicious, yet very greasy. And they have really great coffee. \n",

            "The guy at the table behind us ordered tamales, and I will be going back very soon for them- they looked awesome.\n",
            "These tacos were incredible!  In Austin there are so many taco places that you do not want to waste your time getting an average taco. These tacos were definitely not that- definitely 5 star worthy and worth the wait on a 107 degree summer day. \n",
            "\n",
            "I got the Migas taco and the chorizo and egg breakfast taco. I had hear how popular the migas taco was so I knew I had to get that. It definitely lived up to expectations but what I was even more wowed by was the chorizo and egg taco. The chorizo was so flavorful! Also, all 3 salsas were delicious. Definitely spicy but that is what I love!\n",

You can get two types of pizza and I did not know this but would have liked to try figs and prosciutto. They have pasta dishes too which I did not try but going to go on limb and say it is good. Also the portions are big. The prices are expensive but you can feed 3-4 people per pizza. Had a lot of left overs and it was just two of us.\n",
            "usually i avoid underground restaurants, but grotto is the perfect spot for a clandestine rendezvous (actual or imagined!). so romantic, with incredibly delicious comfort food and a good wine selection. i love the ever-changing, seasonal menu - the pumpkin ravioli is my favorite, though it is not always available. i also enjoy the sweet potato ravioli and find that it is a delicate blend of sweet and buttery.\n",
            "This place is excellent and I am glad we have it so close by in Clintonville. I have only been once so far. I had the thinly sliced flank steak w/garlic and general tso's. Both dishes were the best I have had. Very fresh with a lot of veggies. I will definitely be back for more and to try the sushi and Thai dishes they offer.\n",
            "We often go there on Saturdays for their brunch. I loved their \"Everything Omelette\", which tastes great but not too salty. Last Saturday we went there a bit late and missed the brunch hours, so I tried their Herb Chicken Panini which was also a blast. I really loved this place! Only wish it opened on Sundays too.\n",

            "We had an awesome meal with Milawna and her trainee, Jorge. We had the Bang Bang Chicken, The Combo, and the kids Kettle Grilled Chicken. Everything was hot and tasty and their service was awesome! Oh, we also had the giant pretzel, which was hot and tasty!\n",
            "To be honest, my friends and I were all skeptical about the place initially because we did not think that darts and a good cafe would coexist in one place. But we took the chance and tried anyways. We were pleasantly surprised by their quality desert and friendly service. \n",
            "I went back there a few times and it looks like they lowered the prices on some items like mille crepes, which is great. Not sure they even need the darts to bring customers in really. They could just put more tables and just focus on the food which is already good with great service. But maybe that is just me.\n",

It is not huge so I have usually gone off peak hours or early. The pizzas can be split up half/half. I usually make my own but their menu options are good as well!\n",

Maybe I am a bit (okay, a LOT) biased, but this is the perfect fit. Then, the fun retro decor and vibe without things being over the top. I wanted to spend hours here. Add in the fun vintage drawings on the menu, the comforting food, and friendly service and we have got a real winner on our hands. \n",

The flaky butteryness put Popeye's to shame (and yes, this is something that Sauced should be proud of). I also sampled the canape (more biscuit goodness) and ordered the skewers: all absolutely delicious, and a little bit different then any other menu I can think of around town. To top things off, the ice box pie: lemony, frozen, goodness. \n",

            "Okay, I am not from around here.  When I moved to Austin a few years ago, I suddenly realized that bbq is a very personal thing.  And that- much to the disappointment of my local friends- I did not like central Texas style bbq.  Beef and spicy bbq sauce?! Sausage, for pete's sake?  No thank you!  Give me pork with mustard bbq sauce any day.\n",

The hubs and I each got a two-meat plate (and have paid the price- dude, for the love of god, please share a two-meat plate!) with four meats and four sides so as to try them as many as possible.  My favorites were the ribs (tastes as good as home, better than any others I have tried in Texas) and sausage (see, I am assimilating!).  I just do not like beef brisket (sorry, kids) but the hubs said it was good and recommends the moist in particular.  The turkey was good, but it seems even Texans do not mess up turkey.  ;)  We wanted to try the mac n cheese but they did not have any that day, so I tried the squash (good, especially if it were a bit fresher than mine), potato salad (good, like cold mashed potatoes with a hint of celery- the way I like it), and he got pinto beans and roasted potatoes.  I was especially delighted to get a big sweet tea with my meal, that is definitely a must on my bbq list.\n",

While we were there, I saw them change out food for fresher stuff, even though the food that would been out was not empty or particularly old-looking.  Service was friendly.  I am glad Yelp prepared me to be one of the only people in the establishment (three parties came while we were there, and two were take-out orders- good idea, folks).  This place is too good to die (or have such terrible decor).  Fix it, Yelp!  Go eat there!\n",
            "Never have been disappointed with their food. Lots of flavor in their soups. Paintings are unique and the service is fast. Got my food quickly which is good when you come home from work tired and hungry. Lots of choices to choose from, have not tired them all but the egg noodle soup have tons of flavor and veggies that gives it sweetness and taste. Thai tea is a must if you like tea and their ice coffee is good as well.\n",

            "Anyway... the service here is scary quick, I do not mean McDonald's quick where your meal is prepared in 90 seconds... I mean, in the most literal sense possible, your food is prepared before you have a chance to say \"Zo Authentic Gyros\" twice. However, they are consistent with quality, and that quality us excellent throughout the net tire gyro.\n",

However, the gyro does have a load of ingredients that add flavor, and there is salt and pepper available. But even me, who puts salt and pepper on everything died not find the need to add seasoning. They also have very good and strong habanero sauce that you can add. And what does not taste better with a little habanero sauce? Maybe ice cream... Maybe...\n",

            "I love Olive Bistro, but I had not visited the restaurant in over a year. I decided to go back and I was not disappointed. It was just as good as I remembered. I had the Greek Salad with gyro meat and it was tasty and fresh as always! Good prices and speedy,  courteous service.... makes me wonder why I did not come back sooner!\n",

All gluten free!! Try \"The Burger\" & an off menu amazing dish called the \"Sprint Strips w/Caesar salad\" it is chicken strips done in such a way you will come running back for more! Also... They have the BEST \"Crab Pepper Cheese\" soup. You really cannot go wrong with anything. It is just a fun environment, a spot I will continue to frequent regularly.

It is my Brother's favorite and my Father favorite.  Birthdays, anniversaries, and the random Tuesday afternoon.  I love to bring clients here.  They are always super sweet and cook everything to perfection.  If you are looking for a \"show\" you can go spend Twice as much at a place like Benihana's and get food that tastes half as good.  Sakura of Japan has kept this going for generations.  And they will continue to because they know how cook and take care of their guests.\n",

But it can be seen as a prelude--a hint to the main courses to come. Next came the oh-so-heavenly super dynamite roll: tempura-style tuna, freshwater eel and asparagus roll with Sriracha.  This was some of the best tempura I ever had: fresh and crunchy, enough to know it is there, but once attached, it is gone.  The warm sushi gave me a fuzzy feeling as I stuffed bite after bite wanting it never to end.\n",

The top layer was a slightly charred crispiness, and the inside was utmost tenderness.  Maybe the fish was a minute one each side in hot oil, but I know that it was the result of years of good technique training.  As they say on Masterchef: that fish died so that you could make it into a good dish.  Do not screw up.\"  I can assure you that this sea bass would be proud of its afterlife.\n",

For track sushi the portions are right, lowest price in the area, tasty and if the track is missing something you want you can easily order it and it gets to you fast.

Then made our way over to the gnocchi which melted in my mouth. The lamb was unlike any lamb I have had before. It is over a fennel puree that had me craving more. The thin pasta with with sweet shrimp is ok, so I would skip it. Lastly we had the milk and honey. It was the perfect way to finish. It was light and full of flavor. \n",

I would been craving this combo (minus the fried banana) since I left home (RI). I am used to ordering papaya salad from my neighborhood Laotian grocery store, ordering fried chicken from a separate restaurant and eating rice from my rice cooker, so being able to order it all as a lunch special was awesome. I would say the papaya salad (Laos style) is pretty on par with what I get up north. It has pickled crab and is spicy and is pungent and is not all glamorized like I am used to papaya salad being in many other restaurants. The fried chicken and bananas were delicious and crisp. Reminds me of the way my mom makes chicken wings and bananas--fried in some sort of tapioca flour? I would say if you are used to this combo of food or are feeling a little adventurous and are tired of eating Thai or Vietnamese, this place would be a good option for you. Laotian food is really flavorful (spicy, salty, briny, sour) and often slept on. I think the prices are reasonable given the atmosphere is well-decorated, modern, and crisp--not that \"hole in the wall\" feel where you should expect \"cheap\" food.\n",

Best lobster I have had in years. Perfectly cooked. The service was spectacular. Worth every penny!  Cannot wait to return.\n",

The combination of the brie cheese, pear slices, and preserves are fantastic, but make sure you ask them to drizzle it with their organic maple syrup for some sweetness. You will not be disappointed. \n",

(I have been a dozen times) food arrives and to our surprise their old chef Rich is back. (Formerly of C.F Donovan's in Savin Hill) Rich is a great chef and a friendly guy. He walked the food out himself and came back to ask how it was, which it was excellent. I have never been mistreated or disappointed here ever. Recommend Amrhiens to everyone\n",

I also recommend a drink called Cinderella. It is like a Shirley Temple, but with a twist! And very colorful. Non-Alcoholic and all natural ingredients.\n",
            "Great atmosphere, and the food is absolutely fantastic. I recently had a networking event here, and was amazed by the service from the bar staff and Shawn, the manager.

There is a lively music, theater, and arts scene here. Your choices for food are fantastic from traditional American to European, Latin, or The Far East. The downtown core is such a pleasant place to work and live, a wonderful combination of Urban and Green spaces, plus the main street out of downtown is a very nice drive lined with shops on both side and great view of the city skyline. \n",

And to top it off, one of the owners named Lily, came to our table and had a lovely conversation with my girlfriend and I, which provides us with more of a connection than other restaurants. It was obvious she cared what each customers thoughts were and took all advice into consideration. Not to mention, a pitcher of mimosas for only $10?!? Every where else is minimum $18, so remember this come brunch time! My only complaint is that they do not currently do any advertising, which is horrible because not enough people know about Pijiu Belly...guess it will stay my little secret for now (will of course recommend) but come fall, I know word will get out about this great West Midtown restaurant!\n",
            "I ordered the cowboy bone-in ribeye steak.  This was the best steak I have ever eaten.  It was fall-off-the-bone tender, deliciously seasoned, and perfectly cooked.  They serve it in a hot pan sizzling in butter.  So obviously this is probably not the healthiest option, but sometimes you have to forget about diet and just splurge.  I prefer a seasoned steak, so if you like your steaks plain, Ruth's is not the best choice.   This steak was absolutely delicious.  Heaven on a plate.  It was also cheaper than the high end steakhouses I have seen in Las Vegas.  Plus the ambiance, atmosphere, and service was excellent.  Overall Ruth's Chris in Orlando is currently my favorite steakhouse.   My next steakhouse meal will hopefully be at Delmonico and/or Vic and Anthony's in Las Vegas, which I am excited to try.  But Ruth's has set the standard pretty high for a bone-in ribeye.\n",

            "My ultimate fries experience was in Amsterdam at a little outfit called Mannequin Pis.  They were perfect golden wedges of heaven.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, liberally salted, and then smothered in their version of mayo called frite sauce.  You had to guard these fries with your life since the store was located in a pigeon infested strip. I ate these fries every day and still pine for them regularly.  Forget all the other adult guilty pleasures Amsterdam had to offer, I wanted fries.\n",
            "\n",
            "To say the least, I had high expectations for Saus when they opened and they completely lived up to them.  I spoke to the owner who said they soak them overnight to extract all the excess starch, blanch them in oil at 250 degrees, freeze them overnight, and then fry them.  The product is a golden stick of deliciousness - crunchy on the outside, mushy on the inside, and topped with a sprinkle of sea salt.  I had them with the Vampire Slayer, which is a garlicy mayo dip.  This mayo more closely approximates American mayo rather than frite sauce.  This is not a criticism, merely an observation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In either event, this was much much tastier than what Pomme Frites in NYC had to offer.  My fries at Pomme Frites were less consistent with some slightly soggy and others undercooked.  However, I did like their frite sauce more.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the liege waffle, it was also perfect in every way.  Dense, flaky, and full of lumps of pearl sugar.  The outer sugar crystals had caramelized into a delicious crunchiness.  I would recommend eating it with just powdered sugar.  They are delicious on their own.  I used to make them when it was impossible to get my hands on a fresh liege waffle in Boston...no more.\n",

            "I will definitely be back.  I do not go to this area often so in my own selfishness, I wish they were located on Newbury Street or by the park.  I would be there every weekend.  I got the waffle and regular-sized fries, which was perfect for 2 people.  I am trying the poutine next time and hope it will transport me to Montreal.\n",
            "As soon as we walked in, we were met with a delicious smell of smoke from the apple wood. Now, all of us are natively from KC, so we are familiar with the smell of good smoked meats! I got the grilled cheese and added the house ham and I was NOT disappointed. The cheese was really great (also local) and the meat was just right, bread was crispy. All in all, a great sandwich. We split a small fry between two of us and tried the apple cider mimosa and I already looked up the recipe for it. Great choice. Definitely give it a shot!\n",

This is definitely not just another hotel restaurant. I highly recommend it!!\n",
            "Being a very picky person when it comes dining out in general I have to say I was VERY skeptical about ordering sushi in Sanford...oh and at the mall! Well the reviews on here are accurate! I ordered an absolutely delicious roll with several kinds of tuna, jalapeno, and avocado (do not remember the name but they tweaked it for me and made it special). The roll was super fresh on a Wednesday...even more reason why I was skeptical! My daughter ordered the soft she will crab roll and said it tasted fresher and better than a highly rated Japanese restaurant we occasionally visit close to the beach. I am giving Sushi Heaven 5 stars for feeling awesome after eating lots of raw fish....which many times is not the case for me because I am very sensitive to anything not very fresh, preservatives and anything artificial. Do not let this little sushi mall restaurant scare you away. We are coming back for more!\n",

The hubby and I ordered the butter corn ramen with tamago (mine was miso, his was shoyu), and my kiddo got the mini chasu bowl and shared my soup as well. The chasu bowl was seriously tasty, I could easily wolf down the large I think. Both the ramen were super tasty, the noodles had a great texture and my miso was just right. The butter really added to it. Only regret was not getting more meat in mine. Though I wish they put in the chasu from the rice bowl instead, those little nuggets were the bomb. Cannot wait to go back.\n",

The price is still local, the music venue is better than ever before, and now they offer a full wrap around covered patio with heating and table service! \n",

I also ordered a Prickly Pear Mojito, which was a little on the sweet side, but still refreshing and well sized. I really appreciate the speed that food came out, and the fact that our waitress gave us a happy hour last call. I would definitely come back again for happy hour!\n",

We dined here for my husband's birthday and I am so glad that we did! The restaurant was packed on a Thursday evening, so a reservation is highly recommended! We started off with the charcuterie board and each enjoyed a cocktail each. We then both ordered a steak as our entrees - my husband the Ribeye with blue cheese, hash brown, and a Caesar salad. His steak was perfectly cooked, medium rare and melted in your mouth. \n",
            "I ordered the 8 oz. filet, Brussels sprouts, and a Caesar salad. My steak was also good but it did not compare to the flavor and texture of the ribeye. If I were to return I would definitely order the ribeye! \n",

While there is a few different options, the Tokyo Ramen here is by far my favorite, and the best ramen I have had in the city, probably partly due to the fact they make their own noodles fresh. I usually pay a little extra for some extra Chashu Pork, and it is totally worth it.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Also, they are extremely accommodating if you want special stuff that is not exactly listed on the menu.

            "\n",
            "I would also add that you are better off going there in person to eat than ordering food to pick up. I do not know why, but almost every time I have called in an order there something gets lost in translation and I do not always get what I called in for when I arrive to pay up. \n",
            "\n",
            "Happily, this has lead me to try things on their menu I did not even think I would like but did (most of the time), so if you do phone in food for pick up, just confirm what is in the take away bag before you leave. That is what I do now, and if something is amiss they are always apologetic and as helpful as they can be to fix it, although they are so polite about it I usually just roll with any glitches. Still well earned 5 stars regardless of this foible. \n",

            "This restaurant is fantastic! Our server's name was Amber. She was very helpful  and suggested some great menu items and drinks ! Food was very fresh and delicious! We ordered hummus and the pita club with the cheddar corn cakes on the side. It was all amazing!  The atmosphere is very inviting and the staff was very friendly and professional! I will definitely be coming back here to try more of the menu items!\n",
            "This is not what you would expect and it is better then you would expect. This place makes fresh crepes right in front of you and you can pick items off the menu as is, customize them, or build your own. My fav is the Czar - like a chicken Cesar salad in a crepe (see photo).\n",

It was cute and clean inside with maybe around 10 or 12 (?) tables.  We got a falafel plate and a vegetarian plate and took them over to Piedmont Park to eat.  Both were good, but I like the vegetarian plate better, b/c it had falafel plus baba, hummus, and my favorite, tabbouleh.  We would definitely go back.  I was bummed we forgot to order desert.  They have baklava and rice pudding!\n",

The mustard really gives it a little extra flavor and they have a beer selection just large enough to offer some tasty pairings. They usually have something delicious for their monthly special too, and the yam fries are perfect...Mmm, that chipotle aioli sauce. \n",

            "I will admit, the first time I visited, I looked at the menu and thought \"How weird that they only offer one desert...\" Once you eat the donuts, you will get it. You would not want to order anything else from the desert menu after having these. At Romer's, in the desert arena, there can be only one, and I am very glad this is \"the one\". \n",
            "\n",
            "Service is friendly, bartenders are fast, and they put a lot of care into their takeaway service. Packaging is eco-friendly, silverware is actually wood (which is interesting), and they pay attention to details -- When we took some yam fries home, they warned us they left the container itself open in the bag so the fries would not get soggy. All sauces and sides are packaged separately, and everything tastes just as good at home as it does in the restaurant...So if you want to eat there on a busy night (it is packed on game nights!) but do not feel like waiting, do not give a second thought to taking it home with you!\n",
            "It only took 7 years of being in Atlanta to find a good piece of pizza.  Funnily enough it is not even in Atlanta, it is in Decatur.  For the last 7 years I have had friends telling me \"no, really, you have to try this pizza it is just like New York\".  Honestly, it is never like New York, ever.  It is just pizza disappointment, every time.  But Avellino's has a solid pizza.  I have been here twice now and had a great experience both times.  The first time I had the Rustica Pizza. Our waiter, Charlie, was informative and helpful and suggested that we add red onions.   On his advice we did and it was awesome.   Our second visit, the S-P-O pizza (with anchovies on half).  Again, a solid pizza all around.  Crust is just right, sauce is delicious and they use real mozzarella.  My wife and I also shared the rigatoni and Bolognese pasta special.  The pasta dish was excellent. You could tell it did  not come from a box (it is made in Marietta) and the sauce is clearly homemade.  What I like about this place is it is small and quaint.  The servers are friendly and helpful.  They even recognized us when came back the second time.  But the most important is the food, it is really really good.  That is what I have been searching for all of these years.  It helps that I live in Decatur too, but still. Good pizza, nearby, friendly service, mom and pop owned.  Cannot wait to go back!\n",

            "The shop is immaculate and they have a great selection. Staff is extremely nice and helpful.  It is expensive compared to a regular bakery but not for a GF bakery.

YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. i asked for a 2nd (which they happily brought over!) and had to refrain myself from asking for a 3rd since i, well, ordered a whole pizza for myself.....\n",

It was insanely good and this is coming from a person who does not like grapefruit and is not one to be excited about beer. You have to try this place and the beer.  we will be going back.\n",

I had the crab cake benny with a Kale salad instead of the seasonal greens... LOVED the Kale Salad and the crab cakes were amazing! Crab Cakes came with a delicious perfectly cookies poached egg and hollandaise sauce (take not there was no bread, but that did not matter it was still so AMAZING) My mom had the wild mushroom benny with hash browns instead of the salad, she loved it as well. Tried hers the hash browns were so yummy as well as the wild mushroom eggs benny! I thought the prices were VERY reasonable and loved the atmosphere will for sure be back!\n",

            "I ordered the Lamb à la Provençale with ratatouille & potatoes. The bold flavor of the black olives, and other vegetables in the ratatouille complemented the more subtle flavor of the lamb. The complexity of the flavors in the French onion soup made it the best French onion soup that I have tasted hands down. The croissant was the best that I have tasted: lovely taste & texture. French cuisine made right or should I say, Bien Fait?\n",

The first month or so they were trying to get things sorted out in terms of how to do the ordering and it was TRULY a mess. Rather than tell you how it was, I will tell you how it is now (which is 100% better)\n",

            "2.  The $27 a day for Valet parking and the cluster when parking is very chaotic and pisses people off.  get a system that works and this should be included in the resort fee $23 a day so take that $60 a day in fees and give people something for it food credit in the restaurant drink credit for use at the bar, Something !!!  \n",
            "3. stream line check in. never should it take 30 min to give someone your money, a lot of room to improve here maybe even have self check in kiosk set up for people that are tech say enough to type in and swipe a credit card.\n",

They were amazing. the salads and sides were delicious as well. I had a Blackberry sidecar to drink and I would get that again in a heartbeat. Such a good mix of flavors.

The owner even bet me his grilled octopus would live up to the one I ate seaside in my native Cyprus. I was shocked when it was even better! Our young boys devoured their gyro platters as did I, and my wife loved her grilled salmon gyro. The bacon-wrapped dolmades are to die for. Unfortunately we do not live in Portland, but we will make Gastromania a must-visit on any future visit.\n",

I came after a loooong day of teaching and I knew I was taking risk because I have never tried this place. And the last thing a teacher wants after a difficult day is a bad meal. I ordered the Philly portobello with a side of fried cauliflower. The sandwich had the perfect amount of kick and seasoning. I enjoyed every bite. The tomatoes, lettuce etc. The cauliflower gave me that fried goodness fix that I needed. I am so happy! I will definitely be back. And I am already telling my friends. Great job Viva!!!!\n",

The Ravenous Pig being a \"gastropub,\" it is split into two sections: a more formal dining room, and the pub which features bar seating and a couple booths. The pub menu features less expensive entrees, but anything is available. We tried the quail with homemade sausages, which was absolutely delicious and properly portioned (i.e. small, but flavorful enough to be just right). The pub burger was quite good, topped with buttermilk bleu cheese (a bit overpowering) and some grilled tomatoes and such. Our bill came to about $30 each for a couple beers, split appetizer and burgers.\n",

Judging from the food, I agree wholeheartedly. Thank you TenTen.\n",
            "My wife and I have been here 3 times now. The interesting thing about this place, is the different seating options.  Upstairs, there are some tv's and a bar, and then tables.  This feels like a sportsbar kind of place, but NOT bar food, with a great view of the water.  The lower dining room is where you would sit for a family meal, great water views, but a little more quite. Then outside, is a very large patio area, outside bar, and usually a band playing. This is amazing for the views, being outside, and having a party style atmosphere.  They have a mix of simple sandwiches to high end seafood dishes.  We keep trying something different, and have NOT been disappointed.\n",

I love a creative menu, especially at happy hour, and the portions were great. They offered a happy hour white & red wine for $5 that were both excellent (not swill).  We ordered their Dutch pretzels (think NYC street pretzel but foodie version), broccolini with breaded poached egg (delish), beet salad, cheeseburger and a side of their house bread with flavored olive oil.

The Samuel Adams steampot had lobster claws, snowcrab,, clams, sausage, red potatoes and corn.  My BF had the Joe's classic, with dungeness crab, shrimp, sausage, red potatoes and corn.  The wait staff did a few dancing numbers which was quite entertaining, sitting outside to soak up the sun and view was overall priceless.

Loved the look and California feel of inside being open to the \"patio\" area. Good all excellently prepared. Charcuterie plate was fun to explore. Yellow gazpacho was delicious although it is smoothness is not what I know if as gazpacho. Duck entree perfectly cooked and tender. Swordfish great but the thick piece I was served seemed a little under done in center but outside edges not dry so understand the cost/ benefit. Only downside: three entrees served simultaneously but fourth (beet/ goat cheese ravioli) was 2-3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments (delicious creamy polenta) to cool off to much. Delay was noticeable enough that a little mention/apology would  have been nice. Definitely worth going to and would return.\n",

            "The price was also pretty good. Only 9.50 for a huge serving of ribs, mac and cheese, and fried okra. Add 1.50 for the delicious sweet tea, and it makes it a Great meal for the money. \n",

With an assortment of baked goods and pre-made sandwiches/wraps made inside of the Sutton Place kitchen, there is a lot of choice when picking up a small, quick snack/meal.

However, their cakes are very very rich, and can be shared amongst alot of people. My favorite is the Chocolate Hazelnut cake. Thin layers of a chocolate hazelnut crunch sandwiched between layers of moist cake...it is to die for!\n",

We waited in a short, roped line prior to entrance for about 5 minutes so some of the crowd could leak out that was heading into the game.  I wanted to bar hop down Landsdowne but unfortunately every single place had a line and was going to take a good while just to enter.  Crossroads never seemed all that crowded even with the small line and likely potential fire code violations if they let more people in.  \n",

We still needed something to hold us over so we ordered $10 buffalo wings.  I believe it was a full dozen, perfectly crispy and buffalo-y.  The celery was in good shape, not wilted even though it was a bit skimpy and a slaw resided underneath all the wings, an interesting twist.  Delicious.....alright, this is off to a good night!  \n",

            "8:07 rolls around and Lackey throws the first pitch, it is on now. Although I wanted just about everything on the special game menu, the nachos and quesadilla of the day held us over all night.  The $4.50 'dilla ended up being a buffalo chicken option and it did not skimp on chicken even though it was half price.  My only very minor complaint was that it was burnt a bit but not enough to warrant sending it back to the kitchen.  The loaded nachos, down to $5 for the game, were too friggin big to even finish and ended up coming home with us.  Jalapenos were hidden a bit throughout and caught me off guard during a bite but other than that, they were cheesed perfectly, had on a nice lettuce on top (not iceburg) and were such a great deal overall.  Also on the menu at the special prices included a burger for $6.50 and a lobster roll for $8.50.  If my group was larger we would have likely ordered one of each item just to confirm that all the food here is high quality for a dive bar kind of atmosphere.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The best part of the night came about when I hear the hostess arguing with an entitled customer who wwwwaaaahhhh, was not allowed to sit at a certain table because his party was not big enough.  I look up while overhearing the conversation to see they are dawning Cardinals swag.  I hear the guy state, \"there are plenty of other locations on Landsdowne we can go to\".  Good, GET OUTTA HEAH!!  Which they finally did after not getting their way.  \n",

            "Uchiko never disappoints!  The fish is fresh, the flavor combinations really unique, and their service is attentive (aka, allows them to move thru meals faster and turn tables over).  The one dish I am not a fan of is the salmon w/berry & deep-fried kale appie.  Love how unique the dish is, but it is impossible to eat in one bite that includes all the elements.  Last time I was there, the standout dish was the papaya salad with sea bass --- SO GOOD!  It had a southeast asian flair but a hearty fish (instead of the usual shrimp).  Definitely order the brussels sprouts -- it is the best version of this dish ever and will convert the most die hard brussels-haters.  My rec is to focus on the nigiri and apps if possible, and avoid the rolls... which are ok, just nothing special to write home about.\n",
            "Loved Barcelona!! My boyfriend and I decided to come here for Valentine's Day after hearing everyone rave about how amazing it was. We were running late to our reservation but the staff was very friendly and accommodating even though it was a busy night. The restaurant is dimly lit (too dim for photos without flash) but very lively. I love this kind of atmosphere because you can chat with your date comfortably rather than whisper like you might at other quieter restaurants. I am not sure if they bring bread to the table automatically, but we needed to ask for it. The bread was warm and crusty with a soft center -- so good!! Our server was also very friendly and helpful. \n",

            "We ordered tapas to share: grilled hanger steak, farroto, and grilled pulpo. Since we were at a Spanish wine bar, we figured we should also try the seafood paella and sample their wine. My glass of Riesling was great and my boyfriend enjoyed his glass of Sauvignon blanc as well. They also had their wine sommelier in for the night, which was cool to see him help the couple next to us. The food was delicious. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and well-seasoned. The pulpo was a bit too salty but it was so tender -- you never would have been able to tell it was octopus because it was not chewy at all. The mushroom farroto, a risotto made with farro, was probably my favorite of the night. It was creamy and cheesy without being too heavy. Note about the paella: we assumed the paella would automatically be for two since it says minimum two servings in the menu, but were surprised it was one instead because we had not specified. We were fine with having just one serving because it was quite large but if your party wants multiple servings, you should specify to the server! There was a very generous amount of seafood, mostly mussels and clams. To finish the meal, we shared the flan and a glass of port. The flan was delicious and just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy our sweet tooth. \n",

I had only dined here once before, for a business function; and, that was in the location down the street, a few months after they opened.

Sometimes you will get some stuff that is a little dry if it is not in the sauce, but I have liked about 85% of everything I have eaten there.  The people who work there are nice but if you go there in the summer, bring a sweater because the air conditioner tends to be blasting.  I like the fruit juices and honey wine.\n",

The waiter overheard our discussion and practically insisted I get the chicken.  I am glad he did.  The chicken leg was the largest leg I have ever seen.  Both the leg and thigh were moist and hot, but hot in a good way.  I enjoyed every bite of that chicken.  The mashers and gravy were also really good.  The coleslaw was ok, but that is fine, the other items made up for it.

Let us just say it is pure deliciousness of mayo-y goodness, a kick from a rooster friend of mine made of chile pepper, and some other spice found in a pantry. (Do not worry - the sauce is not at all spicy by any means.) I usually get this with of their onion rings, which is actually really good!

A semi techno Greek like music was playing and people were yelling OPAH as they threw hundreds and hundreds of napkins in the air...I was hooked!  We ordered appetizers and entrees which took a considerable amount of time to come out but I could tell our server was flustered by the pace and how packed the place was.  The entertainment with music, napkin throwing, belly dancers made the time go pretty fast.  The food I would give four stars, service four stars and the entertainment five stars.  This will be a place I would want to hit again when we go back down to Orlando...after all me and my daughters ended up on the table dancing the away the night!\n",

This place wrote the textbook on customer service.  My wife and I were seated at a four-top table.  While we were in the process of sitting down, two people descended on the table to break down and clear off the two extra place settings.  Our wine glasses were never empty ( I highly recommend the house Pinot Grigio).  The waiter asked me 'What type of pasta would you like?'.  I asked him 'What kind do you have?'.  His response?

After a full week indoors at the Orange County Convention Center, we were all dying for a little fresh air and it was so nice to sit outside, have some drinks and a great dinner, and enjoy each other's company. We went to several other restaurants that week that were totally unprepared for groups of our size, but the experience at Marlow's was excellent all around.\n",

Let us start with the place is completely vegan with most of offerings in their natural form--which is awesome!  Most of the menus wrap items consist of kale and varieties of couscous the kale is super good, comes in mild and spicy and  you can mix them by percentage  Be forewarned the spicy is SPI-CY and not for the faint of heart.  However, if you are a fan of the spice, you will love it..i know I did.  I have tried only my the wraps as of this review: the Punanny and the Dat Ish wrap.  The Punanny contains a beautiful concoction called coconut corn and the Dat Ish wrap (my fav) has mushrooms and sundries tomatoes.  Go by and try one and support this business!\n",

The entire staff was helpful and professional. We had a party of 5 and the food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. We had the goat cheese risotto as an appetizer and it was hot and tasted delicious. Our steaks were all cooked to the right temperature and the food was hot. One side order was incorrect but it was quickly fixed without any hesitation. Our servers Craig and Sofia were phenomenal!! They were very helpful and prompt and made sure we were satisfied with our visit. It was my birthday and one of the staff sang happy birthday to me and it was so special and sweet!\n",

It was 14.50 and I was shocked at the price but when it came out... Completely worth it! Delicious meats and cheese, olives too. Really delicious. For dinner my husband had the shrimp and sausage arbiatta. It was spicy and delicious. The shrimp were big! I had the baked gnocchi. It was  out of this world. I could not come close to finishing it. For dessert we had the tiramisu. My husband is a tiramisu expert and he said it is the best he is ever had. This place is in a strip mall but you lose that strip mall feel when you come inside and especially when you eat! Do not miss this place. It is so good!!!\n",
            "What a great place to eat. The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable. A great young staff of wait servers made the m experience very enjoyable. Full of energy, knowledgeable, and attentive.  This is a little restaurant on Salem Street in Boston's North end with very little parking, but if you are creative you will find a spot. I had the seafood risotto for my meal with polenta as the appetizer.  We left to go find a place for dessert, but in the end we came back to this restaurant because the dessert menu was the best around.\n",
            "Fantastic place with great atmosphere, food, and beer. The draft beers (local & German) are offered in three sizes: half pint, pint, and gigantic 22oz mug. Everything on the menu sound delicious, but I typically go with the buffet. There you get not only all of their sausages, but the entire gamut of sides. The green beans are out of this world!  Probably the most overlooked item on the buffet is the sausage stew (spicy Bahama Mamas, onions, sauce, and pasta). It is out of this world!  The fudge shop is a must stop as well with plenty of good stuff in there as take home or gifts. The peanut butter Buckeyes are amazing.\n",

            "Now for the food -  One of my favorite dishes, I have gotten take out many times is the yellow curry chicken.  The curry sauce is like a delicious gravy, which coconut flavor mixed in, so good!  I recently tried their vermicelli bowl with pork and Imperial egg roll and it was amazing as well! The pork was perfectly cooked and you could taste that it was grilled, juicy and not dry at all! I recommend pouring the sauce they give you all over and then mix things up a bit in the bowl ... the sauce really brings it all together and adds some great flavor to your bowl.  I also ordered a green tea to drink with my meal, which ended up being so refreshing.  I do the hot tea and then pour it over ice to make cold tea.  \n",

The volume of the music was miraculously, blessedly low.  Yes, we could hear it.  Yes, it set the mood.  But it was in the background.  We could talk.  We could enjoy our meal without our heads and stomachs being bombarded with sound.  We left a large (and larger than usual) tip.  Please, please, please Emma's: keep the volume lower and allow us to enjoy our pizza inhouse more often, rather than grabbing our pies and  fleeing to the quiet of our own dining table to enjoy.\n",

I usually get one of the beef tibs.  If with friends and we are going to eat family style...we will get a veggie combo.  The servers are always nice and welcoming.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  I want to try their desserts but I am always too full by the end of the meal.  Someday.  Already cannot wait ti go back again.\n",

            "All I should need to say is YES.  That is ask you really need to know.  However, I will elaborate a bit.  Nice atmosphere, extremely helpful and courteous staff.  I ordered the Fricassé.  The meat was so tender and flavorful, the sauce was perfect, the eggs, potatoes and cheese all played off each other perfectly.  Fresh squeezed apple juice was delicious.  Short wait for such a popular and busy place.  In conclusion, go.\n",

            "Very cool themed place. Everything from the decor to the menu is focused on superheroes and villains. The food was amazing. I am typically a slow eater but I devoured my food because it was so tasty. I had the spicy shrimp po boy (Mama Boucher) & the sweet & sour Brussels sprouts. The po boy was full of flavor and not too spicy. The Brussels sprouts were definitely worth trying. All in all cool spot with great food options. There is also a full bar.\n",
            "This place is around the corner from my apartment. It is my favorite place to grab a drink nearby. $3 margaritas, salsa lessons and live music (the band members are great people). Say no more. I have had the calamari, patatas Bravas, hummus, and lamb from the menu. My new favorites are the salmon and braised kale! Yasssss I got my entire life. The manager Chris recommended it and I am so happy he did. I loved it. My other favorite person here is Sean, he makes an awesome margarita, I call it the Sean-a-Rita.\n",

            "This place was AMAZING!  First off, the service: We just walked in to order a couple of quick qyros to go since we were driving back to Seattle that night.  All the staff were incredibly friendly, asked us if we wanted water while we waited and we did not have to wait that long.  When we were given our to go bags they included half a loaf of bread with butter as well since we were driving for a while longer.  When we left pretty much all the staff said goodbye to us, including the owner. :)  Secondly, the food: Oh my gosh, I have never had a gyro that tasted SOOOOO good!!!  The tzaziki sauce was incredibly flavorful and the meat was seasoned just right.  The bread that they gave us was very good as well, it was infused with garlic.  I will definitely come back to this place the next time I am in Portland!\n",

Chase, the chef, was so friendly and easy to talk to. He gave me a quick introduction about the food. I was freezing cold and I did not want to ruin my dinner with Tracey S. So, I ordered the 4\" pecan pie ($5). It was so yummy and it was not as sweet as other pies I had before. \n",

They both were the best we had eaten for years! The meats were cooked perfectly, and the small fried patties in my falafel were not heavy at all. The soup was creamy and filling, the side-sized bowl I got was enough for a small meal on its own.\n",

My date and I did not think this was a huge deal, but the staff took it very seriously.  We first were offered free appetizers and tapas, which I thought was generous.  We later found out Diego (manager) offered to cover our ENTIRE bill. Amazing. As a whole, the staff was standout and very gracious. Will be coming back for sure for another fun night. Thanks!!!\n",

The bread was crispy and toasty on the outside, chewy and light in the middle. The chicken was nicely spiced, and the whole thing was smeared with a generous helping of some kind of crazy spicy mayo. Add on some fresh crunchy veggies and some cilantro, as well as a bit of fresh jalapeno, and you have got something pretty tasty.\n",

We ended up coming on St. Patrick's day weekend when it was extremely crowded but the service was still incredibly quick and the food did not feel rushed at all despite the long line. The fries were great but the variety of sauces is what really makes this place great. They take something simple like fries and really capitalize on them. I would not recommend this place for a date or a sit down as the seating area is not very large but its great to take out and enjoy while walking around the area.\n",

The meat is ground daily and the buns are made fresh in their own bakery.

The duck was succulent and not greasy as is the mistake of most.  I had the request of no pesto.  I can now say I wish I had not made that request.  My meal without it was a culinary delight, but I wonder what chef's vision originally was.  There were five others in my party.  Repeatedly, there were very high praises on the fresh bread, the lightness of the eggs and of course the crispness of the bacon.  As an out of town traveler, I would have to suggest to you the reader that this hamlet of a restaurant is worth your time and deservedly, your business.  It is a decision you will NOT regret.  Thank you Chef to you, your BOH and FOH teams.  We will definitely return.\n",

We agreed to try the Sega Bebaynetu combination for 2, which comprised healthy servings of boneless chicken, spicy lamb, sautéed beef, and mild vegetable stew, mild lentils and a house special salad. The spices were entirely foreign to me, but became instant friends. \n",

The crepe-like injera bread, forming a three-finger scoop, is simple and fun, especially when done at one of the traditional woven-reed Mesob tables near the front of the house.\n",

I have always been a fan of Thai curry, and every time I go here I order the daily curry. My favorite is probably the green curry, but I have tried them all and loved them all. Their Pad Thai is good and other dishes I have had are good, but curry is why I go there, and why I love it.\n",

It is a little hit-or-miss, but the dumplings are great, and the spring rolls are not bad either. I also enjoy the soups (come early in the lunch shift for chunkier soup.) And if you like tapioca, the desserts on the bar are enjoyable too.\n",

You may be able to ask for extra spicy or milder-spicy, but I do not know because I have never wanted to. I recognize everyone is spice-sense is different, and my \"spicy\" might be way too mild for a Tough Guy like you, but on one visit I had a friend who could not eat his green curry because of the spice, so I give you what warning I can.\n",

I got half a chicken, tortillas, two kinds of salsa, charro beans, and rice for $7.00.  Dave got 4 pork tacos with cilantro and onion for $6.  SOOOOO good.  This chicken was among the best I have ever had.  It was flavored perfectly yet was not greasy in the least.  In fact, we left there feeling as though we had just eaten a relatively healthy Mexican meal.  Instead of refried beans, they had these charro beans, which I have never heard of.  It was a sort of bean soup with bacon, onion, green pepper, and something unidentified.  The rice was a little bland, but I think that is because it lacked fat.  Dave's tacos were unbelievably fresh tasting.  I would do unspeakable things for a food truck like this back home.  unspeakable things.\n",

I highly recommend the apricot white chocolate chip pecan scone-it is delicious, huge and will fill you up for most of the day, but it is a bargain for only $4.  I just wish I would have asked this to warm it up for me-I bet it would have been ever better.  My husband has ordered several sandwiches there and really enjoyed them. The dining style is so fun an unique-community style seating and rustic long tables and aluminum high chairs. The fact that they serve Nutella on all the tables as a condiment-amazing!\n",
            "this place is awesome, a lot of people are way to picky and expect way too much, if you want a four star experience go to the four seasons or the ritz, if you want great chinese food, probably the best quality chinese food in and around boston for the price, the staff is excellent as well, great value and qualtiy for lunch...this place is great, much better than your typical chinese restaurant\n",

All dishes where so thought out, plated beautifully, and so flavorful! Dishes change seasonally. Service was excellent and friendly with an impressive beer selection. Bravo Barley Swine. Looking forward to Au Duck opening next month!\n",

Half off drinks and special burger! Usually their special burger is the burger you want to get! You can never go wrong with the classic goodnight. I would also recommend getting their burger on a wheat bun! Overall, amazing food and atmosphere!\n",

Our waiter overheard my wife and I discussing this and the next thing we knew, the owner himself came out to describe how they make they their cheese from pasteurized whey. This level of service and attentiveness seemed to be par for the course all meal.  At one point, we witnessed the hostess - dressed in heals - running down the street a block or two to give one couple their forgotten leftovers.\n",

            "Went here last night with a large party of 14 and this restaurant handled our party perfectly!!!! Very prompt and friendly service. The server recommended several great appetizers and she was spot on. She suggested a special appetizer the chef was preparing which was a maple glazed grilled pork belly. She also offered to have it cut up into smaller portions for easy sharing. This pork belly was tender, smoky, crispy on the edges and the glaze was deliciously sticky, sweet and smoky. I ordered the pecan glazed salmon and it was perfectly cooked and the pecan crust was crunchy and the salmon tender with a lemony butter sauce which gave it a citrusy zing. My fried ordered the deep fried lobster tail and I must say I had a bit of food envy!  This dish looked so elegant, rich and decadent and thankfully she let me have a small bite!!! Oh goodness, it melted in my mouth with that expected crispness of the light batter and the velvety texture of the butter. \n",
            "If there is any suggestion I would offer is the wine list needs to be updated. There was no rose's, no prosseco which I feel are readily available at most other high end steak houses. I did have a Shiraz and it was fabulous!!!\n",

I have come 8 to 10 times in the last year, each time expecting it to be gross and it was delicious. I have literally never had a problem or a bad meal.

My wife got the blackened chicken breast over linguini with alfredo sauce.  Just enough of a bite to tingle the mouth but not so much as to dull the other flavors.  I had the fried shrimp over crawfish etouffee. I was surprised at the number of shrimp. I guess I expected 4 or 5 but there were at least 8. They were lightly dusted and fried to perfection  - still juicy and plump.\n",

            "\n",
            "First - the service was great. As soon as the waiter saw one of us pulled out a bottle of wine, he came over with glasses and a corkscrew and happily helped us open the bottle, we did not have to ask. He was very pleasant without being overbearing all evening. \n",
            "\n",
            "The food.. omg the food. I had the Ropa Vieja - a shredded skirt steak dish served with rice and beans and plantains.. It was delicious, and they put something in the rice (butter? some sort of fatty goodness I am sure) that made it irresistible. The husband's dish of Puerco Asado was even better - the slow roasted pork seriously melts in your mouth. I snuck more than a few bites.. and might have eaten all his leftovers when we got home. Maybe. I am not going to tell. The entrees were large - they give you a large portion of meat, and no one could finish theirs! So while I was initially put off by the prices, I now think that the delicious entrees were worth it. This is not a place I would go every week, but definitely will come back to once in a while.\n",

I used to work 5 nights a week graveyard and every morning when I would get off at about 7:30am I would go over to Sharis and order the 16oz. T-Bone steak. It came with 2 eggs, a side of hash browns, sausage, bacon, toast, and I always got the country gravy. I would take it back to Burger King and eat it. It was basically my dinner and oh was it so good. Not once in like and year and a half was I disappointed. After a while they would have it ready for me every morning and that was so nice. The staff was so great to me and other customers who went in there. Other times when I went during the day the treated me just as well. This is problem one of the best Sharis I have ever been too. Go there, eat, and be happy. Oh, and you can not forget about all the great pies they have!\n",
            "What can I say? My favorite. They have the best white and coconut cake anywhere. The cupcakes are just as good. I have called in orders and they deliver promptly. I order from them frequently so send or purchase someone a birthday cake. The packaging is just as creative. It comes with a plastic cake slice attached to the box.\n",
            "OK, you burger-holics, drop it now.  Yes, the burgers here are among the finest in Austin.  But at some point it is like arguing Franklin vs. JMueller vs. Stiles Switch vs. Chisolm Trail.  Who cares? They are all great!\n",

            "What puts Nau's in a category by itself are the club sandwiches.  A rare art form done as well as they are here.  The richness of the bacon, the salty substance of the ham, the soothing blandness of the American cheese - the ingredients on my favorite, but you can get any combo you like, including turkey.  The crunch of wheat toast, the crisp iceberg lettuce, the coldness of the tomato, and the silky smoothness of the mayo - all in harmony and counterpoint to the proteins.  This is damn near perfection, and only related to Subway in the dictionary.\n",

If you do not go for too long there will be an empty feeling from your taste sensors that can only be filled with more shabu shabu.  This means that people that end up at odds will end up in a bitter custody battle over who gets to go on what days.  It is not worth it, only invite the worthy.\n",

I just want to put out there that you are getting free-range, locally raised, organically-fed meat that is so fresh it might look up at you. This is the beef, the chicken, pork, salmon, all of it. \n",

Maybe you would come up with $8 for the home-made version -- so to have a professional chef prepare it for you for $12 is pretty amazing to me, when I really think about it. (they have to pay their rent (upwards of $6000 a month I have heard) pay their staff, heat the place up, keep super fresh stock, advertise, etc etc etc etc). \n",

            "Yet with all the sleekness and comfort provided in the room, I was surprised that the towels, washcloths, and bathrobe were of average quality. \n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, the Peabody boasts a number of eateries, a spa, a gigantic curvy pool, marching ducks, and more oohs and ahhs than I have time to mention.\n",
            "Now THIS place knows how to make a fresh, delicious and authentic pizza!  I loved the casual atmosphere and the unusual combinations featured on their menu.  We ordered ours with fresh mozzarella, basil, spinach and mushrooms.  it was truly the best pizza I had ever had.  Two years later, it is still #1 on my list, although I have tried a new place closer to home (in central Maine) that is very close to the top.\n",

            "I really enjoyed dining at Pizza Oasis and will definitely visit again when I am back in Portland!\n",
            "This place has the best bagels--right up there with Bagels you get in New York deli's. I had a bagel with lox--and it was incredibly delicious--super fresh--incredibly delicious!\n",
            "My friend and I decided to check this place out this week for our date night since she had read about it in Texas Monthly. Yes it is tiny, yes it is cramped as you sit elbow-to-elbow with randos...but the food is EXCELLENT.\n",
            "\n",
            "The two of us shared a bottle of Rioja and then were advised by our sweet waitress to get about 3 plates per person. Without hesitation we ordered:\n",
            "\n",
            "-Brussels Sprouts: just get them. tangy/crispy/fried/awesome. I was wanting to order more but I realized we had 5 more plates coming. It is a pretty small portion but enough for 2 people.\n",
            "-Carrot salad:greens and grilled carrots tossed in a delicious creamy but light dressing. Highly recommend as another starter.\n",
            "-Pickled gulf shrimp- solid, but not my favorite. I had never had pickled shrimp before, it was different.\n",
            "-Sweetbreads- we did not find out until after eating this that the term \"Sweetbreads\" is actually a lie/code for thymus gland. I felt uncultured for not knowing this. It tasted good but sort of had the consistency of animal fat. \n",
            "Scallops and shortrib- also both tasty.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would say if I went back (which I likely will) I would skip the gulf shrimp and sweetbreads but would definitely order everything else again, with maybe an extra order of the brussels sprouts. The service was great, and the manager came to chat us up afterward. Definitely a great experience and I highly recommend!\n",

            "We were looking for another seafood place when we happened upon Barking Crab.  We had Red Sox tickets and not a huge amount of time to eat.  We were seated quickly right on the water.  Our waitress, Courtney, was the best.  Super friendly, but professional.  Helpful with the menu and suggestions.  My husband had the traditional lobster roll and I had one with butter, no mayo.  Both were excellent.  Our drinks were super.  We never felt rushed and enjoyed our dinners.  Will definitely return when in Boston again.\n",
            "Historical space, awesome ambiance, delicious drinks, and friendly, knowledgeable bartenders. The best bar in town!\n",
            "This place is AMAZING. I came here on a Friday night after downtown and had some really great tacos with friends. I left very happy..that is until I realized my wallet was missing. After having a 12 hour panic attack over how I was going to pay my rent that was due in two days, I decided to check back here to see if maybe it was here. I was positive that it was not. I asked the man working, Les, if there was any chance in hell someone turned it in. His face lit up, asked my name, and sure enough my wallet was there. Not a single penny of my $450 dollars was missing, and Les said he was planning on mailing it to me if I did not come back.\n",

            "We came here on a Saturday afternoon, with no real plans but to order s Guinness and see where the day takes us. It was a great afternoon filled with 4 Irish beers that we sampled. We had our 5yr old with us and he enjoyed the multiple TVs and N64 in the back. \n",

            "And i recently i buy pizza and it was something. I could not stop myself becouse it was so good. I got a pizza with chicken, broccoli and alfredo sause. It was really good combination actually. I just ask the girl on register what kind of pizza is her favourite and she say this one. In their menu it is called nachek pizza and you getting chooice of white sause: alfredo or ricota cheese. \n",
            "If you have some questions or you do not know what to get go and ask the girls on register they always nice and give you good advise. \n",

            "And i went in evening recently and they have life music. That was fun. The group name was LOOSE CHANCE i believe. And they were good actually.  I like their idea about life music and also twise a month in saturday the piano man coming around 12 till 2 so you have nice lunch with life music. I believe it is a good place to spend time\n",
            "I have been to the Wing Factory in Dunwoody on a number of occasions.  Having lived in Dunwoody for over a decade this is THE place to be for ice cold beer, fresh food (yes fresh) and great sports viewing!  This is locally owned with ties to the Dunwoody area.  I encourage you to try it out - you will not be disappointed!\n",
            "i am NEVER disappointed when i eat here! the food is amazing and the staff? fantastic!!! The staff is ALWAYS warm and friendly and the atmoshere can NOT be beat!\n",
            "They just started Sunday brunch! I guess the hours on Yelp have not been updated yet. The food and atmosphere are awesome. Not pricey either.\n",

            "Grab a coffee and go to chill in Boston Common!\n",
            "I went here a few years ago before I was married. I must say, this is one of the better steaks that I have had in Austin. Tender, juicy and just plain delicious.  \n",

            "The decor is nice and the waitstaff is great. I would hug the chef if I could.\n",
            "Wow. This is the king of all sandwich shops. Healthy, friendly, and more than delicious. Get your toasted sub on ciabatta bread! Tastes like it just came out of the oven!!\n",
            "Amazing!!!! We went because of the amazing reviews, and they definitely lived up to the hype. The lady that took our order was super sweet and helpful. We ordered the Ahi tuna salad, I think it was called the Ahi Paki. The food did not take too long to come out.  When we got it we were immediately surprised at how much ahi tuna it was! It was $13 (market price) but you definitely get your money's worth!! It was so much food that my boyfriend, who usually eats 2 meals, had leftovers. The food was so fresh and flavorful, it was everything I had hoped for!\n",
            "Great beer, great music, and typically packed for these reasons. It is a wonderful Irish pub with tons of flavor.\n",
            "This place never disappoints.  We have come here for date night and with small children and teenager.  It makes everyone happy and is small enough that you feel comfortable and at home.  The flavors are amazing and variety does not disappoint.\n",
            "Love this place for breakfast! Me and my husband go there a lot and they do not dissappoint, we only do breakfast there and have not tried their lunch menu\n",
            "Great outdoor seating and overall ambiance. Food is okay if a bit pricey for what you get. I enjoy the hookah although the flavor selection can be limited. Overall one of my favorite spots in Cambridge to work, enjoy hookah/tea/a meal, and meet with friends.\n",
            "Destination restaurant and specialty market/deli that is right next to Rt 1/ I-95.  Beer offerings in the cafe consist of an excellent (although limited) selection of hard to find mostly German brews on draft, and a good selection of European bottles as well.  Pork schnitzel with house-made sauerkraut and potato pancakes was delicious.  Fresh from the oven pretzel with Obatzda Cheese Spread was tasty enough to require a second order. If you are lucky, you may get to watch their sausage maker at work through a large glass window that views into an impeccably clean looking commercial kitchen.  This place is a regional treasure.\n",
            "By far one of my favorite restaurants. Whenever my parents and friends ask if I want to meet at Thai Orchid I take them up on it! Great spot for some wonderful food. I have only ever ordered one thing that I did not like, and that is only because I ordered it too spicy (I do not really like spicy very much). So be warned, do not try to be a tough guy, if you do not like spicy, just order mild, there is no sin in that.\n",
            "Absolutely amazing and truly authentic Mexico flavors. Growing up in Arizona and actually spending a lot of time in Mexico I have become spoiled to good Mexican food. Moving to Florida sent me on a search for great Mexican food and I about gave up until I found this place. The food is amazing and the staff ( all family ) are great. I really recommend checking out taco tuesdays. All tacos are just $1 also thursdays is 1/2 off burritos. Everything is fresh and made to order so expect a little bit of a wait. Be sure to check out the house made salsa bar and if you like it extra spicy like me be sure to ask for the ghost pepper salsa they make. Great food and even better prices\n",
            "Simply amazing. Enjoyed the chefs tasting with 6 friends had a great time and was really happy with the service, the waitress and the food. If I lived in the area this would be a non stop spot to hit up.\n",
            "I love this place. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is amazing. Some of the best chicken tikka and saag paneer  I have had, even in comparison to pricier Indian restaurants.\n",
            "Awesome Ramen! Authentic and great taste. I had the  Spicy Mi-So and was pleasantly surprised that the spice level was perfect (it is usually too low for me at many places). You order at the bar, but they go the extra mile in checking at the table if you are happy and/or need anything. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.\n",
            "The owners name is Houston and she is not from Texas.  She was extremely kind when giving directions to my friend and Houston stayed on the phone the entire trip until she made it.  What a gal!  \n",
            "\n",
            "This place has kick ass martinis, like the melon ball with infused liquors, for only $4 during the happy hours.  Sometimes, I would go workout and finish at 7:30pm, just to make it to their happy hour.  I think this place turned me into an alcoholic.  For that, it gets 5 stars.\n",
            "Lamb burger and steak were great! Ask for Hannah. She knows her stuff kids loved the Mac and cheese and the game tables are a lot of fun.\n",
            "We used to stop there to pick up sausages. Now, they have a restaurant. And it is good!  Brez'n! Wienerschnitzel! Spätzle! Hefeweizen! All that good stuff you find in Germany but now it is here. I had brez'n and weinerschnitzel, washed down with a Weihenstephaner hefeweizen. My wife had the spätzle. Alles Gute!\n",
            "\n",
            "The staff is delightful -- all German nationals or offspring of German nationals. Service was good, food was good. I recommended Karl's to a colleague of German descent who immediately manufactured an excuse to haul his wife there for Saturday lunch. He loved it, too.\n",
            "This burger boutique was wow. I had a great time here. The milkshakes were so good! So were the burgers. It is such a trendy spot for a date or drinks with friends. I wish we had one where I live. The waitress we had was uber nice with a very pronounced southern accent. \n",
            "\n",
            "The lamburger was amazing!\n",
            "We hosted an event here and it went very well. Bill and Dan (the karaoke DJ) were exceptionally helpful and responsive in their communications beforehand. The upstairs area and the food were fully set up even before we arrived. It was a cozy space with large windows and a beautiful view of the Christmas tree. The service was quick and friendly, and Dan was great hosting the with the karaoke - everyone had a great time! Overall, highly recommended for an event.\n",
            "Warning! This restaurant may become habit forming. After numerous recommendations, I finally took my wife Sunday for her birthday! Amazing experience to say the least, and Yancey, our waiter, was top notch. We will be back again, and again....\n",
            "Legit food. Definitely going back. Avocado salmon toast was the bomb, and the specialty drinks were also superb.\n",
            "How I went years working downtown without knowing about this place makes me sad! So much money has been wasted on average salads...\n",
            "\n",
            "I usually get a medium garden salad with a protein... either egg or chicken... it ranges between 5-7 dollars. Usually a salad downtown ranges between 8-10 or even more if you want all the \"good stuff\".  The salad has everything you would want in a salad, all the good stuff, carrots, olives, cucumbers and they mix the dressing in. I recently got a garden salad with buffalo chicken and it was amazing. \n",
            "\n",
            "The salad fills me up, sometimes I cannot even finish in one sitting, eventually I need to get something else like pasta or pizza but for now I am so happy to have found awesome salads at a reasonable price!!\n",
            "This place is awesome. Great service, great food. I got the Hercules (paleo version) with steak instead of chicken and it was filling and delicious. Definitely will be coming back to fill up my punch card.\n",
            "Such a cute little food truck! The owner is from Maui! He is super friendly and the food was delicious, I got a chicken bowl with sticky rice and a Japanese salad on the side. It was soooooo good. I highly recommend it!\n",
            "The best vegan restaurant in the A!! I always get the Philly!! Make sure you call your order or you will be waiting about 30 mins!\n",
            "This bowl creeps up on you and blows you are mind! When I first got it I thought it was small but it is a great size. It is full of flavor and any sauce you put on it compliments the original bowl ingredients. I am super satisfied with this bowl and the person working here is super positive too. She presented my bowl saying \"tadaaaaa\" with a big smile :D\n",
            "Excellent food and great service; shout out to our server Xavier; this is authentic Mexican food;  fajitas mixta was excellent.  This place is where local Mexicans go for Mexican food - that is got to be good.\n",
            "I absolutely love this place - best bagels in Portland. They have a sea salt bagel that is to die for! (Fair warning, you must love salt). Great options: tons of bagel flavors, different spreads, breakfast sandwiches, espresso drinks (matcha latte is my favorite!)\n",
            "\n",
            "I also love the staff here; I probably stop in once a week; they remember me and are so friendly!\n",
            "Great vibe at this place. Exactly the type of coffee shop you are always looking for. It has a diverse menu and the food looks tasty. The staff here is very friendly and efficient. There is pride in their work!\n",
            "The selection of wines and the quality of food at this Wine Bar is amazing for the price and the service. As soon as I got there I was greeted by the bartender/waitress and she asked me what kind of wine I liked. She kindly offered me about 4 different wines to taste before I made a decision. Their wine list is very edgy/funky. I really enjoyed every single cup I had there. The food (tapas - like) is also AMAZING. I had the caprese salad, the pumpkin ravioli and the tuna. Everything was excellent. \n",
            "The combination of the service and the quality of the food/wine, make of this spot a must-go, even if you do not live in Lynn. The commuter rail from North Station takes about 15 mins to get there and the Lynn station is about 1 walk away from Turbine.\n",
            "Visiting Portland and we had to try the food carts! Thai Basil was very friendly and their menu stuck out with its varied menu. It took a little while to get our food, but it was worth the wait. It was fresh with a lot of flavor and HUGE portions. Neither my husband or I could finish all of it. We both got the chicken pad thai and loved it!\n",
            "First time here. Very good all around.  Awesome mojito Margherita and delicious food!\n",
            "I love this place!  Me and a close friend of mine find any excuse we can to go for a trip to Golden Tent. Great variety, everything is always fresh, the staff is super friendly and the place is always very clean. My favorite Mongolian food in Clark county!\n",
            "Prezza is pretty much the best place I have been to in Boston for dinner. The food is unbelievable and the service was great. Be prepared to pay for it though. Great place to go to for a spacial night. Skip dessert and hit up Mikes Pastry's:) Love the veal chop.\n",
            "I have a business trip that brings me to Portland twice a year, and each time is finished with a decadent dinner.  It is usually at a different restaurant each time, but after our last trip ended here, I begged the person who picks the place to take us here again.  I am so grateful they agreed.  \n",
            "On both visits, we were amazed by the quality and creativity of our food. Metro Vino has a local and house-made emphasis that I really love, and I highly recommend ordering items of the nightly specials.  My boss ate a butternut squash soup here last time with chorizo meatballs that I had only a bite of, and remember the moan that escaped me - and she, a butternut squash devotee, says it was the single best butternut dish she has ever tasted. \n",
            "Last night, we shared the exquisite baked escargot and button mushrooms app, the grilled bacon-wrapped dates with arugula salad, and charcuterie plate to start.  All were delish, but the dates were a dish that demands to be described as sexy.  The salad that accompanied them was tasty and crisp, but the dates themselves were smoky bits of goodness with the perfect blends of salt/sweet, crisp/smooth.  \n",
            "Then we all had a special called the \"Spring Salad.\"  I am 7 months pregnant, and this is the first thing I want to taste after I give birth, when I have been starved and suffering for who knows how many hours.  It had chilled asparagus, lush minor's lettuce, crisp fiddlehead ferns, and fresh dill, with spoonfuls of a dungeness crab salad mix punctuated by celery and red onion, all dressed in an herb vinaigrette, and to smooth out all this verdant springy goodness, sweet poofs of morel mushroom cream mousse.  Amazing. Exquisite.  There was more moaning.  \n",
            "I had the rib-eye for my entree, which was topped with mushrooms cooked perfectly and lavish slivers of truffles, also delish, and we shared three desserts - all good, but I especially loved the panna cotta - orange and sweet cream, smooth-sweet and tart-sauced, slipping into my mouth in greedy bites before I was forced to pass the plate on to my companions.  \n",
            "I left this meal deliriously happy. Thank you MetroVino.\n",
            "The whole Noche experience was wonderful from start to finish! The service was top notch, our server overheard it was my birthday and came out with dessert! The plantain chips were delicious, the grllled romaine salad was awesome, the paella was some of the best! Highly recommend!\n",
            "My fiancé and I ate at Vtopia for the first time today.  We had the Caprese Salad, Reuben Sandwich and Club Sandwich.  All were great.  My fiancé who is not a vegetarian thought they were better than any meat or dairy based versions.  \n",
            "The building Vtopia is located in is very non-descript with no signage, so it is easy to miss.  Even with my GPS I almost missed it, but it is worth searching out.  We will back again, and often.\n",
            "Great small place with big delicious gyros! Very easy to order and pickup or just sit down. Only place of its kind in this part of town, glad its here!\n",
            "Amazing dinner last night with husband and HS friends.  DH had apples and oranges cocktail and I enjoyed quintessential while we waited for our friends - both were great! Fluke and duck confit apps were stars of the first course, while pork chop, arctic char and scallops all performed amazingly well as mains.  Wine (sauv blanc) was nice compromise and paired well with all choices.  Waiter was so helpful and patient!  We did have a late seating (so popular!), but staff were awfully nice to let our reunion continue late - we were the last to leave.  Thank you 80 Thoreau!  We will be back again soon.\n",
            "Beef rib was to die ---- Brisket was really good too but a little fatty. The tangy BBQ sauce was the best. Green beans, baked beans, mac & cheese, coleslaw, jalapeño cornbread were all solid.\n",
            "Super friendly staff, quick service and my blizzard was loaded with heath bar goodness!\n",
            "My favorite burger in Austin. I love this place- the food is amazing, the staff is helpful and friendly, and even though there is a wait, it is worth it (I promise)! You can even order drinks in line to help with the wait. I HIGHLY recommend the Nutella pretzel milkshake- it is easily the best milkshake I have ever had. I also recommend the truffle fries- they taste fresh and come with a wonderful dipping sauce. ALL of the burgers are tasty- I usually get the plain burger and build onto it with bacon, etc. amazing!\n",
            "One Flew South is a glowing beacon of hope for my long layovers in ATL, an airport that for the most part lacks any sort of interesting or desirable foods. My family and I stopped there on the way back from an international flight and were delighted by everything from the decor to the service and DEFINITELY the food.\n",
            "\n",
            "The decor is beautiful and relaxing, with life-sized photo-realistic tree wallpaper and an open dining room. The bar is chic, but the chair backs in the dining area could be a little taller. It was difficult to really lean back and relax.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our waitress, Sopee, was an absolute delight. She was friendly, bubbly, and enthusiastic--not your typical ATL staffer. She was able to recommend many things on the menu and talked freely about them. She was also very attentive and conscious of the time we had between flights. One of the consulting chefs, Dwayne Nutter, has competed on Iron Chef, which delighted a geek like myself. The music was lovely as well\n",
            "\n",
            "The food was fantastic. We ordered the spicy tuna, butternut squash salad, quail, and the duck and porcini ravioli with chocolate sauce. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful, and we cleaned every plate. The standout was definitely the quail, which was cooked perfectly. We all agreed we could have had about 5 more. The ravioli and spicy tuna tied for second, with the ravioli having some combinations that at first seemed very weird, but then melded together wonderfully. The tuna, though a common-sounding preparation, took a very fresh twist with the cucumber, chive, and mayo it was served with.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hope to have enough time between layovers to visit One Flew South on every trip, and eventually work my way through the menu. It delights me that food this good, that would easily hold its own as a stand-alone restaurant, is available in my frequent airport hub.\n",
            "My friend told me they had an amazing Cuban sandwich, and he was not kidding!  Complimented it with the Brussels sprouts and got the exacta!  Highly recommend...and great tunes as well :)\n",

            "Awesome brunch !!! Will come back and its a must try for anyone looking for a place to have some delicious brunch\n",
            "Here on business and a friend recommended! They are packed at lunch so get there early! Gyro was delicious. Seasoned fries were good. Iced tea was flavorless. Waitress was so super nice. Food came out quick :) apparently they have a Greek beer but I was working - maybe I will stop after work! Big bonus that they take American Express so I could charge it with my company card!\n",
            "We came as part of Groupon deal. I was not sure if I am going to like - but the result was amazing. The food was great. We ordered the udon and lo mein - just regular menu items with chicken. It was delicious and a loooot.\n",
            "Came here today after searching yelp for some good crepes. Happy to have found ARUGULARIUM!! I had a banana cream pie crepe made with buckwheat, delicious!!!  Husband had a fig crepe made with buckwheat , enjoyed it very much!  Great coffee as well. We will definitely be back. They also have great assortment of baked goods. The staff gave great service, such a friendly atmosphere. A happy place indeed :).\n",
            "Amazing lamb skewers, cheese pizza, shrimp scampi Pizza, and chicken broccoli pizza. Crust is soft with crunch. Flavor is great everything is season well. \n",
            "Food cones out fairly quickly and is always hot and fresh . The bar is in the center of the restaurant and can be viewed from any side of the place. Staff is friendly but not very upbeat. Leftovers are still great the next day.\n",
            "I have been about five times now and I have to kick this place up to five stars.  Everything is amazing.  The food, beer and service are top notch.  On top of that Wolf's Ridge is a locally owned family business.  One of my new favorites in Columbus!\n",
            "My first visit to Troy, I regretted ordering ONLY one plate of beef Iskender. I could have totally eaten a second helping. Instead, I left filled with regret.\n",
            "\n",
            "Luckily, Troy is close to my office and my house. So, needless to say, I have been back a few times just to eat the beef Iskender, which is served with a heaping side of yogurt and drizzled with browned butter. \n",

            "This is my go to place for ramen even though I would like to try others in Boston. And I have been in Japan several times and know ramen. This is a bit different but very delicious and satisfying: I continue to always order the hot and sour ramen with extra noodles - my favourite.  I was there again on a chilly day yesterday and I always arrive early so I do not have to wait. I always have the same server who is always friendly. Once again, it did not disappoint. So I would disagree that the place has changed or gone 'downhill'. I enjoy going to the Shops at Porter for both ramen and other Japanese food and for shopping  the nice Tokai nearby. That is one of my traditions. I will go often this winter not only because I love it but because it is something like cold and flu medicine in this season! And I like to take the train to Porter from Boston and then walk all the way back to Downtown Boston. I will share with friends this winter, also. Thank you, Sapporo!\n",
            "Turkish food at its best. Great ambiance in a good downtown location. Our waitress was particularly good. Food quality is great. Good attention to detail. Real plates and cutlery!  We really enjoyed the dining experience. Highly recommend!\n",
            "I am not vegan, but I think Mark and Imber's cheeses are some of the best I have ever had.  My top favorites:  raspberry brie; caramelized onion; green olive/red pepper; and the maple seating ball.  Really, they are all great, whether you have vegan or not.  We have these at dinner parties and guests love them.  Their cheese plate and hyam melt sandwich were excellent - their \"meats\" come from the Homegrown Smoker BBQ, which also has amazing Yelp write-ups.  We liked their version of the melt with a nice little salad even more than the HSB's food truck.  The cheese plate was lovely with little jams and beautiful organic fruit, bread and crackers.  And how could you not want to support the incredibly nice owners?  This is only the second vegan cheese shop in the country.  We are so lucky to have it in Oregon.  I hope to see them in business here for a long, long time!\n",

I was craving the traditional beef noodle dish, and my food here did not disappoint! Lots of flavor, and wow the noodles are so fresh!! I will definitely return here & bring friends... and try something new!\n",
            "It is really nice to have a good Indian restaurant in the Brighton area. The staff treated us really well and were quite attentive to us. As vegetarians, it is really nice to have a place with so many options! I definitely suggest the paneer masala and the paneer korma, both just wonderful dishes complemented by really fragrant rice. My partner and I will definitely make this place a  regular stop. \n",

It is so nice to finally get to eat out, not worry about gluten contamination and not be eating cardboard!!!  My husband had the fish tacos (\"best fish tacos since living in San Diego\" - the husband) and I had the Chili fry cod fish and chips.  Amazing!   I cannot wait to come back!\n",
            "This place is legit! So good. Their blackened fish tacos are to die for. Totally recommend this place.\n",

            "My favorite Japanese steak house. Great value for lunch. The food is excellent and never burnt.\n",
            "First let me say this place is an older establishment. It has been around many years. Looks very unassuming from the outside. The inside is clean and most importantly the food is great! The chicken we ate was freshly cooked and the sides were very tasty . I loved the new mac and cheese bites! It was my first time there, but since the reviews on yelp were pretty good I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. I will defiantly be back! This chicken is some of the best I have eaten.\n",
            "Great sandwiches. The place was crazy busy on a Saturday at lunchtime, but understandably - the food is great. Lots of interesting sandwich concoctions.  I wish I could have tried more of the menu. Highly recommend for a quality lunch spot that is authentic and will not break the bank.\n",
            "OMG their \"Clam Bake\" was great! My chick lobster was more than adequate -- large, tender, and FRESH! And the clams and mussels were extremely fresh and delicious as well. The whole meal was absolutely fabulous. Highly recommend. It may look touristy, but let me tell you, the food is wonderful. Legal Seafood if you must, but Summer Shack if you can!\n",
            "I have no complaints about El Barrio, because I have yet to have an experience at this place that is negative in any way. The food is authentic (as near as I can tell) and delicious, prepared with care and sass. Staff is friendly and really wants you to enjoy yourself. They are willing to bend over backwards to make sure you have something to eat, even if you have dietary restrictions.\n",

The EXPLOSION of flavors between the blue cheese topping and drizzle of au jous on the plate... coupled with the PERFECT melt in my mouth temperature is TO DIE FOR!  This is NOT an ordinary \"grille!\"  And the bartender/servers Nicole and Scott were so warm and welcoming!  It is our new favorite spot!!!!  A++++\n",
            "Absolutely delicious! Very low key, but cleans, simple, and to the point. I tried the salmon and it was delicious, very flavorful. My friend got the Kafta and is very satisfied. Definitely recommend!\n",
            "The food is really really good. The customer service here is great. They can handle large crowds which is good. I think they provided the best customer service I have ever experienced. They are a little pricey but it is worth it. Did I mention that the food is really good!\n",
            "I love Thai food and have been to Thailand. Most of the THai food in the US is Americanized, meaning too much sugar in it. THis is one of the few Thai restaurants in town that does not do that and is quite original, everything I tried is delicous. we are very happy with it.\n",

            "When we arrived, we were greeted by the same guest relations manager who had helped us previously. She was pleasant and professional and sat my husband and I at our reservation before the rest of our party arrived. We had a chance to talk about what had happened last week and she was very apologetic, as were we. It was a frustrating experience from the beginning and she had agreed and helped make this dinner celebration more memorable! We had a chance to clear the air before the other guests came (and I will not go into detail) but it was a nice talk and made us feel more comfortable about returning. \n",

            "Our waiter was Mark ( my mom really liked him ) and he was attentive. The food was good, we ordered appies and a main course each. I had the rotisserie chicken (which had I known was that good I would have ordered it last week). Followed by the apple pie! It was overall a pleasant experience and I thank Jesse and his team for taking care of us at Joey Coquitlam. I truly believe that with business everyone gets the same chance to wow their audience (their consumer) and some times things happen that you cannot control or you may have misinterpreted and things can go sideways, but it is how you intened to fix things and create a positive outcome. Jesse and his team did a great job at that and as a business owner I admire that, and believe they have a great leader and a team that respects him so they were able to do that. So good for you, this is where the 5 stars are truly deserved.\n",
            "Such a lovely experience! Cozy atmosphere, eclectic menu and friendly service. We ordered small plates (5 for 3 people) and everything was excellent, amazing flavor! My favorite was the trout and avocado toast and the shrimp ceviche. We went on a Sunday evening around 6:30 and we were able to walk right in and be seated. By 7:00 the place was full so go early!\n",

            "We always visit here when we have to visit the hospital around the corner. The steak fajita nachos are my favorite and SO good! My husband and I are both fans of the queso dip and the chips and salsa are great! Our chips were so warm they almost just melted in your mouth. I wish this restaurant was closer to where we live!\n",
            "To say I LOVE donuts would be an understatement. It is exciting to visit new and/or unique places that feature donuts. Our first time to try a Valkyrie Donut was when we visited Foxtail Coffee Co. they sell Donuts from the Valkyrie Donuts. Well, we liked the donut so much that we drove across town to experience Valkyrie full strength with all of their glorious spread of tasty donuts! We chose a half dozen of flavors we did not experience at Foxtail and there was not one we did not like. I will say that my favorites were the different berry flavored toppings. Now being that this bakery is about an hour from home, you might think we will not make it out there as often. Not true, they are that delicious. Nice large square shaped risen Donuts that must be made by Donut Angels sent from Donut Heaven.\n",

            "El primo makes them larger than most of the other trucks around, but not as big as torchy's...they are also less expensive than torchy's (we got 5 tacos for 10 bucks).  They have a couple of tables in the shade with a great view of South 1st.\n",

The special Patriots burger my husband said was the best combo of flavors. We sat at the bar and Chris was our server. He was great knowledgeable and made a great meal a really great experience. I would totally recommend wahlburgers to everyone and they especially do a wonderful job with gluten free!!! We will be back!! Thanks Walhburgers and thanks Chris!!\n",
            "The yummiest breakfast place in Portland to be had so far.  The menu is very good and has a great selection of wonderfully inventive dishes.  I always get the Everything Nice because I am a sucker for selection.  This dish comes with 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pieces of french toast, potato pancake, fruit and your choice of a breakfast meat.  I can never eat it all.  The line here can be brutal but if you get there from 8-8:30 you can usually get right in.  That takes some commitment on a weekend morning.  They have self serve coffee while you wait, you get to choose from an array of darling mismatching cups.\n",

            "I had the Fish Tacos. I liked them. They were good.. My inner fatty wanted there to be more then two. It was $7.25 for two tacos and a bowl of black beans (you could chose your side). I am definitely going to go back!! I liked the atmosphere and I liked the waitress I LOVED the fact that the Mavs game was on while I was there. The waitress noticed i was breaking my neck to watch the game after i mentioned i was a mavs fan so she asked if I would like her to turn the TV in front of me on the game I was watching... Wow.. a woman after my heart! catering to my alcohol, food and sports desires!! I am here for one more week.. ill go back a time or two!!\n",
            "One of the better way stations on 6th for a slice. Greasy, cheesy, deliciously sinful. They do a 30\" slice for the daredevil in you. Hoeks has always been a bit of a tourist stop, strictly because of the nonstop metal, but it holds its own among the droves of other random Italian themes ropollos clones. It is this & Hoboken, take your pick. Many friends have worked here over the years. I would consider it a staple. Thanks for all the hard work Jason!\n",
            "Food this good in an airport? I must be dreaming. This place has great drinks (I like the modern old fashioned) and great food. I have been here three times and it was nothing short of stellar. If they have the shrimp and grits, they are a must. Mussels, burgers, and pork belly sliders are also awesome. There is free wifi also. If you have any time at all in ATL, you should make the trip down to terminal E for a great meal.\n",
            "Very attentive service and great food. I ordered the shrimp beignets and the seared tuna salad. I thought the shrimp beignets were alright but my boyfriend really enjoyed them, especially the sauce that came with it. The seared tuna salad had a great balance of flavors to it. My favorite dish was one my mom ordered--soft she will crab sandwich. That was deliciousss. Id definitely recommend.\n",

            "Came here randomly on a Thursday night and so glad I did! As soon as I entered was greeted and seats were available. It is a decent size restaurant/bar. Well hidden, but not too hidden. The atmosphere is laid back and super chill. Great music selection too. I walked in and was instantly impressed. I sat on a wall length wooden bench and they had pillows which was something I did not expect at a restaurant. Made the seat really comfortable. Now for the food: AMAZING. My boyfriend ordered a burger that was cooked to perfection. Fries were good too. I had the buffalo cheese dip with tortilla chips and my mouth was watering. SO GOOD. I would definitely recommend this establishment. We are DEFINITELY coming back here again. We did not order drinks so we cannot comment on those. But there is a fancy screen that updates beer stats.\n",
            "Me & a couple friends came down for a weekend & saw this place had happy hour specials so decided to stop by. The food was good we got the salmon, angus sliders, bang bang shrimp tacos, & the ribs. The drinks are bomb my favorite was the Orange rum swizzle & the Snowberry. Our bartender was Keenan (sp?) he was the best kept the drinks coming & made them good. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food & drinks when they come to Atlanta.\n",

            "5 stars for this little find! As their sign says, this is not fast food, it is fresh food. We had the poke bowl, po'boys, fries and fritters--all delicious. Looking forward to trying more from their menu. Love their Wasabi slaw #mmmm\n",
            "Looking for a new culinary journey to take your taste-buds on?  Look no further.  Maenam packs flavour and flare into every bite.

            "Dishes are portioned and spiced perfectly.  But the number one dish you must try while you are here: the mussels.  Steamed to tender perfection with Thai basil and lemongrass and accompanied by nahm jim sauce -- a light yet, flavourful sauce with a bit of heat that sneaks up on you at the end.  I would also highly recommend the 8 Spice Crispy Lingcod, which lives up to its name but is rather sweet, though it compliments the fish really well; as well as the Grilled Tuna Salad with Green Mango (Dine Out 2015 menu item), with lots of fresh herbs and crunchy cashews this dish is incredibly balanced in both flavours and textures.  They also have an Aromatic Curry of Lamb Shank (on their regular menu, not included on their Dine Out 2015 menu) which is out of this world delicious, truly curried comfort food.\n",

The customers are not always very nice, in fact, some are down right rude. I have literally had someone push me to get to the counter before me. Obviously, they needed to be there forest, so ok. The olive bar is great too! I love this place & crave it on the regular.\n",

            "Bob'sit was always great. It has survived the test of time. Bob's is one of the last authentic Italian stores in greater Boston. The subs are off the hook. Today I got an Italian despite the fact I am going to the Red Sox game and will be sitting in close quarters. I tried to hold off but crumbled when I made the order. The Italian sub is made with fresh bread   - I took the version with sesame seeds, imported Italian cold cuts for the most part, the correct Italian cold cuts, no lettuce of course, but tomatoes pickles onions and hots. It was perfect. If you want to try a real Italian sub order it.\n",
            "I highly recommend coming here over the original Sushi Junai by UT campus. This restaurant is big and has so many more sushi chefs and servers. Their customer service is also great and I loved it how multiple servers came by frequently to take orders or to see how everything is going. The wait is long to get the food but bearable and definitely not as long as the other Sushi Junai. This place can get busy so I recommend making a reservation. If not, you should be able to get a seat at the bar.\n",
            "I was there on Wednesday while spending the day in Atlanta.  I ordered oysters, and. chicken Caesar salad, both of which were fantastic.  I was served by a really sweet waitress named Briana.  She made my experience absolutely fantastic, and I hope I get served by her again.\n",
            "I was a loyal fan of Aroy before the ownership change, so I was apprehensive. After visiting several times, I can tell it will be my lunch refuge when I need a small and quiet place to eat dependably good food.\n",

Two rolls were enough for my wife and I to share. The Volcano and Melting Pot Maki are highly recommended. Wait staff was awesome. We will return.\n",

            "I have a lot of dietary restrictions and this place was spot on! I had a superfood salad with a burger patty. The first round, my patty was not cooked enough (med-rare when it should have been medium), but after they corrected that - it was delicious! Some others at my table had medium as well and their's was med-well to well done, which I would have been fine with. The food was delicious and I was very happy to be feeling well after eating it :)\n"
